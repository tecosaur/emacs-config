#+title: Pile Theme

A sass-based set of styles to be used by Org when exporting to HTML.
=main.scss= is compiled to =main.css= which is then inserted into the ~<head>~ of
generated HTML documents.

This is a modified version of [[https://lepisma.xyz/][lepisma]]'s lovely [[https://github.com/lepisma/pile-theme][pile-theme]].

A little non-essential JS has been added to provide:
+ Functionality for copy-to-clipboard buttons
+ Have the table of contents auto-expand based on the current scroll position

* Development
To build =main.css= and =main.js=, I simply run

#+begin_src shell
sassc main.scss main.css
#+end_src

Then for combining the JS

#+begin_src shell
ls _*.js | sort -V | xargs cat > main.js
#+end_src
