#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
computer to do. --- Donald Knuth
#+END_QUOTE

* Intro
Customising an editor can be very rewarding ... until you have to leave it.
For years I have been looking for ways to avoid this pain.
Then I discovered [[https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere][vim-anywhere]], and found that it had an emacs companion,[[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere][
emacs-anywhere]]. To me, this looked most attractive.

Separately, online I have seen the following statement enough times I think it's a catchphrase
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Redditor1: I just discovered this thing, isn't it cool.
Redditor2: Oh, there's an emacs mode for that.
#+END_QUOTE

I tried out the =spacemacs= distribution a bit, but it wasn't quite to my liking.
Then I heard about =doom emacs= and thought I may as well give that a try.
TLDR; it's great.

Now I've discovered the wonders of literate programming, and am becoming more
settled by the day. This is my config.
* Rudimentary configuration
Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]]
for more info).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+END_SRC
** Personal Information
It's useful to have some basic personal information
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "tecosaur"
      user-mail-address "tecosaur@gmail.com")
#+END_SRC
Apparently this is used by ~GPG~, and all sorts of other things.
** Better defaults
*** Simple settings
Browsing the web and seeing [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]] and comparing with the values
shown by =SPC h v= and selecting what I thought looks good, I've ended up adding the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 tab-width 4                                      ; Set width for tabs
 uniquify-buffer-name-style 'forward              ; Uniquify buffer names
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't
      inhibit-compacting-font-caches t)           ; When there are lots of glyphs, keep them in memory

(delete-selection-mode 1)                         ; Replace selection when inserting text
(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line
(display-battery-mode 1)                          ; On laptops it's nice to know how much power you have
(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words
#+END_SRC
*** Fullscreen
I also like the idea of fullscreen-ing when opened by ~emacs~ or the ~.desktop~ file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(if (eq initial-window-system 'x)                 ; if started by emacs command or desktop file
    (toggle-frame-maximized)
  (toggle-frame-fullscreen))
#+END_SRC
*** Auto-customisations
By default changes made via a customisation interface are added to =init.el=.
I prefer the idea of using a separate file for this. We just need to change a
setting, and load it if it exists.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" doom-private-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+END_SRC
*** Windows
I find it rather handy to be asked which buffer I want to see after splitting
the window. Let's make that happen.
First, we'll enter the new window
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+END_SRC
Then, we'll pull up ~ivy~
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (+ivy/switch-buffer))
#+END_SRC
*** Buffer defaults
I'd much rather have my new buffers in ~org-mode~ than ~fundamental-mode~, hence
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default major-mode 'org-mode)
#+END_SRC
For some reason this + the mixed pitch hook causes issues with hydra and so I'll
just need to resort to =SPC b o= for now.
** Doom configuration
*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face
'Fira Code' is nice, and 'Overpass' makes for a nice sans companion. We just need to
fiddle with the font sizes a tad so that they visually match.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 22)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 36)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :size 24))
#+END_SRC
**** Theme
~doom-one~ is nice and all, but I find the ~vibrant~ variant nicer.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-vibrant)
#+END_SRC
However, by default ~red~ text is used in the ~modeline~, so let's make that orange
so I don't feel like something's gone /wrong/ when editing files.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+END_SRC
**** Miscellaneous
Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+END_SRC
I'd like some slightly nicer default buffer names
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+END_SRC
There's a bug with the modeline in insert mode for org documents ([[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline/issues/300][issue]]), so
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces! '(doom-modeline-evil-insert-state :weight bold :foreground "#339CDB"))
#+END_SRC
*** Some helper macros
There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map~ for binding new keys
To find more,
** Other things
*** Editor interaction
**** Mouse buttons
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
#+END_SRC
*** Window title
I'd like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
    '(""
      "%b"
      (:eval
       (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
         (unless (string= "-" project-name)
           (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+END_SRC
*** Systemd daemon
For running a systemd service for a emacs server I have the following
#+BEGIN_SRC systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/emacs.service
[Unit]
Description=Emacs server daemon
Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/bin/emacs --daemon
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --eval "(progn (setq kill-emacs-hook nil) (kill emacs))"
Environment=SSH_AUTH_SOCK=%t/keyring/ssh
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+END_SRC
which is then enabled by
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
systemctl --user enable emacs.service
#+END_SRC
* Package loading
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle "packages.el"
:END:
This file shouldn't be byte compiled.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle "packages.el"
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
#+END_SRC
** Loading instructions
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
This is where you install packages, by declaring them with the ~package!~
macro, then running ~doom refresh~ on the command line. You'll need to
restart Emacs for your changes to take effect! Or at least, run =M-x doom/reload=.

WARNING: Don't disable core packages listed in ~~/.emacs.d/core/packages.el~.
Doom requires these, and disabling them may have terrible side effects.

*** Packages in MELPA/ELPA/emacsmirror
To install ~some-package~ from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! some-package)
#+END_SRC

*** Packages from git repositories
To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
a ~:recipe~. You'll find documentation on what ~:recipe~ accepts [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format][here]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! another-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+END_SRC

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a ~PACKAGENAME.el~
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+END_SRC

*** Disabling built-in packages
If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
you can do so here with the ~:disable~ property:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+END_SRC
You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+END_SRC

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
our package manager can't deal with; see [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/issues/279][raxod502/straight.el#279]])
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+END_SRC
** General packages
*** Auto-complete
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! company-tabnine ; tab9 autocomplete
  :recipe (:host github :repo "TommyX12/company-tabnine"
           :files ("company-tabnine.el" "fetch-binaries.sh")))
#+END_SRC
*** Prettification
~prettify-mode~ is nice and all, but adding substitutions is a little verbose.
This helps with that.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! prettify-utils ; simplify messing with prettify-mode
  :recipe (:host github :repo "Ilazki/prettify-utils.el"))
#+END_SRC
*** Window management
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! rotate)
#+END_SRC
*** Fun
Sometimes one just wants a little fun.
XKCD comics are fun.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! xkcd)
#+END_SRC

Every so often, you want everyone else to /know/ that you're typing, or just to
amuse oneself. Introducing: typewriter sounds!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! selectric-mode)
#+END_SRC

Hey, let's get the weather in here while we're at it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! wttrin)
#+END_SRC

Why not flash words on the screen. Why not --- hey, it could be fun.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! spray)
#+END_SRC

With all our fancy emacs themes, my terminal is missing out!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! theme-magic)
#+END_SRC
*** Other
**** Flyspell-lazy
To alleviate some [[Flyspell][issues with flyspell]]
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! flyspell-lazy)
#+END_SRC
**** CalcTeX
This is a nice extension to ~calc~
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! calctex :recipe (:host github :repo "johnbcoughlin/calctex"
                                 :files ("*.el")))
#+END_SRC
**** ESS
View dataframes better with
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! ess-view)
#+END_SRC
** Language packages
*** Systemd
For editing systemd unit files
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! systemd)
#+END_SRC
*** Org Mode
Org tables aren't the prettiest thing to look at. This package is supposed to
redraw them in the buffer with box-drawing characters. Sounds like an
improvement to me! Just need to get it working...
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! org-pretty-table-mode
  :recipe (:host github :repo "Fuco1/org-pretty-table"))
#+END_SRC
Because of the /[[https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/markdown-flavors][lovely variety in markdown implementations]]/ there isn't actually
such a thing a standard table spec ... or standard anything really. Because
~org-md~ is a goody-two-shoes, it just uses HTML for all these non-standardised
elements (a lot of them). So ~ox-gfm~ is handy for exporting markdown with all the
features that GitHub has. Initialised in [[Exporting to GFM]].
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! ox-gfm)
#+END_SRC

Now and then citations need to happen
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! org-ref)
#+END_SRC

For automatically toggling LaTeX fragment previews there's this nice package
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! org-fragtog)
#+END_SRC

Came across this and ... it's cool
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! org-graph-view :recipe (:host github :repo "alphapapa/org-graph-view"))
#+END_SRC

I *need* this in my life. It take a URL to a recipe from a common site, and
inserts an org-ified version at point. Isn't that just great.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! org-chef)
#+END_SRC
* Package configuration
** Abbrev mode
Thanks to [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45462/use-a-single-abbrev-table-for-multiple-modes/45476#45476][use a single abbrev-table for multiple modes? - Emacs Stack Exchange]] I
have the following.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package abbrev
  :init
  (setq-default abbrev-mode t)
  ;; a hook funtion that sets the abbrev-table to org-mode-abbrev-table
  ;; whenever the major mode is a text mode
  (defun tec/set-text-mode-abbrev-table ()
    (if (derived-mode-p 'text-mode)
        (setq local-abbrev-table org-mode-abbrev-table)))
  :commands abbrev-mode
  :hook
  (abbrev-mode . tec/set-text-mode-abbrev-table)
  :config
  (setq abbrev-file-name (expand-file-name "abbrev.el" doom-private-dir))
  (setq save-abbrevs 'silently))
#+END_SRC
** Centaur Tabs
We want to make the tabs a nice, comfy size (~36~), with icons. The modifier
marker is nice, but the particular default Unicode one causes a lag spike, so
let's just switch to an ~o~, which still looks decent but doesn't cause any
issues.
A 'active-bar' is nice, so let's have one of those. If we have it ~under~ needs us to
turn on ~x-underline-at-decent~ though. For some reason this didn't seem to work
inside the ~(after! ... )~ block ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
Then let's change the font to a sans serif, but the default one doesn't fit too
well somehow, so let's switch to 'P22 Underground Book'; it looks much nicer.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! centaur-tabs
  (setq centaur-tabs-height 36
        centaur-tabs-set-icons t
        centaur-tabs-modified-marker "o"
        centaur-tabs-close-button "×"
        centaur-tabs-set-bar 'above)
        centaur-tabs-gray-out-icons 'buffer
  (centaur-tabs-change-fonts "P22 Underground Book" 160))
;; (setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)
#+END_SRC
** Company
It's nice to have completions almost all the time, in my opinion. Key strokes
are just waiting to be saved!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! company
  (setq company-idle-delay 0.5
        company-minimum-prefix-length 2)
  (setq company-show-numbers t)
(add-hook 'evil-normal-state-entry-hook #'company-abort)) ;; make aborting less annoying.
#+END_SRC
Now, the improvements from ~precident~ are mostly from remembering history, so
let's improve that memory.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default history-length 1000)
(setq-default prescient-history-length 1000)
#+END_SRC
*** Plain Text
~ispell~ is nice, let's have it in ~text~, ~markdown~, and ~GFM~.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-company-backend! '(text-mode
                        markdown-mode
                        gfm-mode)
  '(:seperate company-ispell
              company-files
              company-yasnippet))
#+END_SRC
We then configure the dictionary we're using in [[*ispell][ispell]].
*** ESS
~company-dabbrev-code~ is nice. Let's have it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-company-backend! 'ess-r-mode '(company-R-args company-R-objects company-dabbrev-code :separate))
#+END_SRC
** [[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere][Emacs Anywhere]] configuration
# NB: install with curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere/master/install | bash
It's nice to recognise GitHub (so we can use ~GFM~), and other apps which we know

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  (or (string-match-p "Pull Request" window-title)
      (string-match-p "Issue" window-title)
      (string-match-p "Discord" window-title)))
#+END_SRC
When the window opens, we generally want text so let's use a nice sans serif font,
a position the window below and to the left. Oh, and don't forget about checking
for ~GFM~, otherwise let's just use ~markdown~.

**** Troubleshooting
In case the remote shell is misbehaving, here are some things to try

There are some escape code you don't want, let's make it behave more considerately.

#+END_SRC
** Treemacs
Quite often there are superfluous files I'm not that interested in. There's no
good reason for them to take up space. Let's add a mechanism to ignore them.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! treemacs
  (defvar treemacs-file-ignore-extensions '()
    "File extension which `treemacs-ignore-filter' will ensure are ignored")

          (dolist (regexp treemacs-file-ignore-regexps ignore-file)

  (add-to-list 'treemacs-ignored-file-predicates #'treemacs-ignore-filter))
#+END_SRC

Now, we just identify the files in question.

***** LaTeX Fragments
It's nice to customise the look of LaTeX fragments so they fit better in the

We can either render from a ~dvi~ or ~pdf~ file, so let's benchmark ~latex~ and
~pdflatex~.
| ~latex~ time | ~pdflatex~ time |
|------------+---------------|
| 135±2 ms   | 215±3 ms      |

On the rendering side, there are two ~.dvi~-to-image convertors which I am
interested in: ~dvipng~ and ~dvisvgm~. Then with the a ~.pdf~ we have ~pdf2svg~.
For inline preview we care about speed, while for exporting we care about file
size and preffer a vector graphic.

Using the above latex expression and benchmarking lead to the following results:
| ~dvipng~ time | ~dvisvgm~ time | ~pdf2svg~ time |
|-------------+--------------+--------------|
| 89±2 ms     | 178±2 ms     | 12±2 ms      |

Now let's combine this to see what's best
| Tool chain         | Total time | Resultant file size |
|--------------------+------------+---------------------|
| ~latex~ + ~dvipng~     | 226±2 ms   | 7 KiB               |
| ~latex~ + ~dvisvgm~    | 392±4 ms   | 8 KiB               |
| ~pdflatex~ + ~pdf2svg~ | 230±2 ms   | 16 KiB              |

So, let's use ~dvipng~ for previewing LaTeX fragments in-emacs, but ~dvisvgm~ for [[
Exporting to HTML][LaTeX Rendering]].
/Unfortunately: it seems that svg sizing is annoying ATM, so let's actually not do this right now./

As well as having a sans font, there are a few other tweaks which can make them
look better. Namely making sure that the colours switch when the theme does.

** hledger
~ledger-mode~ is great and all, but ~hledger~ seems to be more actively maintained.
For example, from 2018--2020, the most prolific contributor to ~ledger~ produced
31 commits. For ~hledger~ this statistic is 1800 commits. In addition, over the
last decade, ~ledger~ seems to have lost steam, while ~hledger~ seems as actively
developed as ever. From this basic comparison ~hledger~ looks to have a more
promising outlook. It also has a few extra nicities that ~ledger~ doesn't, but is
a little slower (~haskell~ vs. ~c++~).
Since this uses the same format, and ~ledger-mode~ is well integrated into emacs,
and produced by John Wiegley --- author of ~ledger~ and current Emacs maintainer
--- using this seems like a good idea. Thankfully we can, with a little modification.
