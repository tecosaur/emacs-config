#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
computer to do. --- Donald Knuth
#+END_QUOTE

* Intro
Customising an editor can be very rewarding ... until you have to leave it.
For years I have been looking for ways to avoid this pain.
Then I discovered [[https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere][vim-anywhere]], and found that it had an Emacs companion,[[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere][
emacs-anywhere]]. To me, this looked most attractive.

Separately, online I have seen the following statement enough times I think it's a catchphrase
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Redditor1: I just discovered this thing, isn't it cool.
Redditor2: Oh, there's an emacs mode for that.
#+END_QUOTE

I tried out the =spacemacs= distribution a bit, but it wasn't quite to my liking.
Then I heard about =doom emacs= and thought I may as well give that a try.
TLDR; it's great.

Now I've discovered the wonders of literate programming, and am becoming more
settled by the day. This is my config, and also a cautionary tale.

[[xkcd:456]]

** Notes for the unwary adventurer
If you like the look of this, that's marvellous, and I'm really happy that I've
made something which you may find interesting, however:
#+begin_warning
This config is /insidious/. Copying the whole thing blindly can easily lead to
undesired effects. I recommend copying chunks instead.
#+end_warning

If you are so bold as to wish to steal bits of my config (or if I upgrade and
wonder why things aren't working), here's a list of sections which rely on
externally setup (i.e. outside of this config).

+ libvterm :: I rely on my distro-provided =libvterm.so=, [[*VTerm][vterm]] sets a compile flag.
  If this causes issues, just delete the ~(setq term-module-cmake-args ...)~ bit.
+ dictionary :: I've downloaded a custom [[http://app.aspell.com/create][SCOWL]] dictionary, which I use in [[*Ispell][ispell]].
  If this causes issues, just delete the ~(setq ispell-dictionary ...)~ bit.
+ uni-units file :: I've got a file in =~/.org/.uni-units= which I use in ~org-capture~
  If this causes issues, just remove the reference to that file in [[*Capture][Capture]] and
  instances of ~unit-prompt~ used in  ~(doct ...)~

Oh, did I mention that I started this config when I didn't know any =elisp=, and
this whole thing is a hack job? If you can suggest any improvements, please do
so, no matter how much critisism you include I'll appreciate it :)

[[xkcd:1513]]
*** Extra Requirements
The lovely ~doom doctor~ is good at diagnosing most missing things, but here are a
few extras.
+ The [[https://github.com/dandavison/delta/][Delta]] binary. It's packaged for some distributions but I installed it with
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
cargo install git-delta
  #+END_SRC
+ A [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][LaTeX Compiler]] is required for the mathematics rendering performed in [[#org][Org]],
  and by [[*CalcTeX][CalcTeX]].
+ I use the [[https://overpassfont.org/][Overpass]] font as a go-to sans serif.
  It's used as my ~doom-variable-pitch-font~ and in the graph generated by [[*Roam][Roam]].
  I have chosen it because it possesses a few characteristics I consider
  desirable, namely:
  - A clean, and legible style. Highway-style fonts tend to be designed to be
    clear at a glance, and work well with a thicker weight, and this is inspired
    by /Highway Gothic/.
  - It's slightly quirky. Look at the diagonal cut on stems for example.
    Helvetica is a masterful design, but I like a bit more pizazz now and then.
+ A few LSP servers. Take a look at [[file:init.el][init.el]] to see which modules have the ~+lsp~ flag.
+ The =cargo-script= rust crate is required for evaluation of rust blocks by babel.
  As described in the README for [[https://github.com/micanzhang/ob-rust][ob-rust]]. Like ~delta~, this can just be installed
  using cargo.
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
cargo install cargo-script
  #+END_SRC
** Current Issues
*** Magit push in daemon
Quite often trying to push to a remote in the emacs daemon produces as error like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
128 git … push -v origin refs/heads/master\:refs/heads/master
Pushing to git@github.com:tecosaur/emacs-config.git

fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
#+END_SRC
*** CalcTeX brings up compilation buffer
With my [[*Calc][Calc]] hook, the first call of =M-x calc= brings up a compilation buffer
from CalcTeX. I'm guessing this is from the compilation of the preamble / ~.fmt~ file.
** Editor comparison

[[xkcd:378]]

Over the years I have tried out (spent at least a year using as my primary
editor) the following applications
- Python IDLE
- Komodo Edit
- Brackets
- VSCode
- and now, Emacs

I have attempted to quantify aspects of my impressions of them below.

#+PLOT: transpose:yes type:radar min:0 max:4 ticks:4 file:"misc/editor-comparison.png"
| Editor      | Extensibility | Ecosystem | Ease of Use | Comfort | Completion | Performance |

* Rudimentary configuration
Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]]
for more info).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :comments no
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+END_SRC
** Personal Information
It's useful to have some basic personal information
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "TEC"
      user-mail-address "tec@tecosaur.com")
#+END_SRC
Apparently this is used by ~GPG~, and all sorts of other things.

Speaking of ~GPG~, I want to use =~/.authsource.gpg= instead of the default in
=~/.emacs.d=. Why? Because my home directory is already cluttered, so this won't
make a difference, and I don't want to accidently purge this file (I have done
~rm -rf~/.emac.d~ before). I also want to cache as much as possible, as my home
machine is pretty safe, and my laptop is shutdown a lot.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg")
      auth-source-cache-expiry nil) ; default is 7200 (2h)
#+END_SRC
** Better defaults
*** Simple settings
Browsing the web and seeing [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]] and comparing with the values
shown by =SPC h v= and selecting what I thought looks good, I've ended up adding the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 tab-width 4                                      ; Set width for tabs
 uniquify-buffer-name-style 'forward              ; Uniquify buffer names
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't
      inhibit-compacting-font-caches t)           ; When there are lots of glyphs, keep them in memory

(delete-selection-mode 1)                         ; Replace selection when inserting text
(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line
(display-battery-mode 1)                          ; On laptops it's nice to know how much power you have
(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words
#+END_SRC
*** Fullscreen
I also like the idea of fullscreen-ing when opened by ~emacs~ or the ~.desktop~ file.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(if (eq initial-window-system 'x)                 ; if started by emacs command or desktop file
    (toggle-frame-maximized)
  (toggle-frame-fullscreen))
#+END_SRC
*** Auto-customisations
By default changes made via a customisation interface are added to =init.el=.
I prefer the idea of using a separate file for this. We just need to change a
setting, and load it if it exists.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" doom-private-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+END_SRC
*** Windows
I find it rather handy to be asked which buffer I want to see after splitting
the window. Let's make that happen.
First, we'll enter the new window
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+END_SRC
Then, we'll pull up ~ivy~
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (+ivy/switch-buffer))
#+END_SRC
Oh, and previews are nice
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq +ivy-buffer-preview t)
#+END_SRC
*** Buffer defaults
I'd much rather have my new buffers in ~org-mode~ than ~fundamental-mode~, hence
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default major-mode 'org-mode)
#+END_SRC
For some reason this + the mixed pitch hook causes issues with hydra and so I'll
just need to resort to =SPC b o= for now.
** Doom configuration
*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face
'Fira Code' is nice, and 'Overpass' makes for a nice sans companion. We just need to
fiddle with the font sizes a tad so that they visually match.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :size 24)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :size 36)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :size 24)
      doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "IBM Plex Mono" :weight 'light))
#+END_SRC
**** Theme
~doom-one~ is nice and all, but I find the ~vibrant~ variant nicer.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-vibrant)
#+END_SRC
However, by default ~red~ text is used in the ~modeline~, so let's make that orange
so I don't feel like something's gone /wrong/ when editing files.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+END_SRC
**** Miscellaneous
Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+END_SRC
I'd like some slightly nicer default buffer names
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+END_SRC
There's a bug with the modeline in insert mode for org documents ([[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline/issues/300][issue]]), so
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces! '(doom-modeline-evil-insert-state :weight bold :foreground "#339CDB"))
#+END_SRC
*** Some helper macros
There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map~ for binding new keys
To find more,
** Other things
*** Editor interaction
**** Mouse buttons
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
#+END_SRC
*** Window title
I'd like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
    '(""
      (:eval
       (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
           (replace-regexp-in-string ".*/[0-9]+-" "🢔 " buffer-file-name)
         "%b"))
      (:eval
       (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
         (unless (string= "-" project-name)
           (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+END_SRC
*** Splash screen
Emacs can render an image as the splash screen, and [[https://github.com/MarioRicalde][@MarioRicalde]] came up with a
cracker! He's also provided me with a nice emacs-style /E/, which is good for
smaller windows. *@MarioRicalde* you have my sincere thanks, you're great!

:PROPERTIES:

:END:
This is where you install packages, by declaring them with the ~package!~
macro, then running ~doom refresh~ on the command line. You'll need to
restart Emacs for your changes to take effect! Or at least, run =M-x doom/reload=.

WARNING: Don't disable core packages listed in ~~/.emacs.d/core/packages.el~.
Doom requires these, and disabling them may have terrible side effects.

*** Packages in MELPA/ELPA/emacsmirror
To install ~some-package~ from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! some-package)
#+END_SRC

*** Packages from git repositories
To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
a ~:recipe~. You'll find documentation on what ~:recipe~ accepts [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format][here]]:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! another-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+END_SRC

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a ~PACKAGENAME.el~
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+END_SRC

*** Disabling built-in packages
If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
you can do so here with the ~:disable~ property:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+END_SRC
You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+END_SRC

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
our package manager can't deal with; see [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/issues/279][raxod502/straight.el#279]])
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+END_SRC
** General packages
*** Prettification

Because of the /[[https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/markdown-flavors][lovely variety in markdown implementations]]/ there isn't actually
such a thing a standard table spec ... or standard anything really. Because
~org-md~ is a goody-two-shoes, it just uses HTML for all these non-standardised
elements (a lot of them). So ~ox-gfm~ is handy for exporting markdown with all the
features that GitHub has. Initialised in [[Exporting to GFM]].

** Centaur Tabs
We want to make the tabs a nice, comfy size (~36~), with icons. The modifier
marker is nice, but the particular default Unicode one causes a lag spike, so
let's just switch to an ~o~, which still looks decent but doesn't cause any
issues.
A 'active-bar' is nice, so let's have one of those. If we have it ~under~ needs us to
turn on ~x-underline-at-decent~ though. For some reason this didn't seem to work
inside the ~(after! ... )~ block ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
Then let's change the font to a sans serif, but the default one doesn't fit too
well somehow, so let's switch to 'P22 Underground Book'; it looks much nicer.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Mail
[[xkcd:1467]]

*** Fetching
The contenders for this seem to be:
 + [[https://www.offlineimap.org/][OfflineIMAP]] ([[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OfflineIMAP][ArchWiki page]])
 + [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html][isync/mbsync]] ([[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/isync][ArchWiki page]])

From perusing r/emacs the prevailing opinion seems to be that
 + isync is faster
 + isync works more reliably
So let's use that.

The config was straightforward, and is located at [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]].
I'm currently successfully connecting to: Gmail, office365mail, and dovecot.
I'm also shoving passwords in my [[file:~/.authinfo.gpg][authinfo.gpg]] and fetching them using ~PassCmd~:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle no :eval no
gpg2 -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d ~/.authinfo.gpg | awk '/machine IMAP_SERCER login EMAIL_ADDR/ {print $NF}'
#+END_SRC

We can run ~mbsync -a~ in a systemd service file or something, but we can do
better than that. [[https://github.com/vsemyonoff/easymail#usage][vsemyonoff/easymail]] seems like the sort of thing we want, but
is written for =notmuch= unfortunately. We can still use it for inspiration though.
Using [[https://gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify][goimapnotify]] we should be able to sync just after new
mail. Unfortunately this means /yet another/ config file :(

We install with
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
go get -u gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify
ln -s ~/go/bin/goimapnotify ~/.local/bin/
#+END_SRC

Here's the general plan:
 1. Use ~goimapnotify~ to monitor mailboxes
    This needs it's own set of configs, and =systemd= services, which is a pain. We
    remove this pain by writing a python script (found below) to setup these
    config files, and systemd services by parsing the  [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]] file.
 2. On new mail, call ~mbsync --pull --new ACCOUNT:BOX~
    We try to be as specific as possible, so ~mbsync~ returns as soon as possible,
    and we can /get those emails as soon as possible/.
 3. Try to call ~mu index --lazy-fetch~.
    This fails if mu4e is already open (due to a write lock on the database), so
    in that case we just ~touch~ a tmp file (=/tmp/mu_reindex_now=).
 4. Separately, we set up Emacs to check for the existance of
    =/tmp/mu_reindex_now= once a second while mu4e is
    running, and (after deleting the file) call ~mu4e-update-index~.

Let's start off by handling the elisp side of things

**** Config transcoding & service management
As long as the =mbsyncrc= file exists, this is as easy as running
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
~/.config/doom/misc/mbsync-imapnotify.py
#+END_SRC

When run without flags this will perform the following actions
 + Read, and parse [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]], specifically recognising the following properties
   - ~IMAPAccount~
   - ~Host~
   - ~Port~
   - ~User~
   - ~Password~
   - ~PassCmd~
   - ~Patterns~
 + Call ~mbsync --list ACCOUNT~, and filter results according to ~Patterns~
 + Construct a imapnotify config for each account, with the following hooks
   - onNewMail :: ~mbsync --pull ACCOUNT:MAILBOX~
   - onNewMailPost :: ~if mu index --lazy-check; then test -f /tmp/mu_reindex_now && rm /tmp/mu_reindex_now; else touch /tmp/mu_reindex_now; fi~
 + Compare accounts list to previous accounts, enable/disable the relevant
   systemd services, called with the ~--now~ flag (start/stop services as well)

This script also supports the following flags
 + ~--status~ to get the status of the relevant systemd services supports =active=,
   =failing=, and =disabled=
 + ~--enable~ to enable all relevant systemd services
 + ~--disable~ to disable all relevant systemd services

**** Systemd
We then have a service file to run ~goimapnotify~ on all of these generated config files.
We'll use a template service file so we can enable a unit per-account.
#+BEGIN_SRC systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/goimapnotify@.service
[Unit]
Description=IMAP notifier using IDLE, golang version.
ConditionPathExists=%h/.imapnotify/%I/notify.conf
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=%h/go/bin/goimapnotify -conf %h/.imapnotify/%I/notify.conf
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+END_SRC

Enabling the service is actually taken care of by that python script.

From one or two small tests, this can bring the delay down to as low as five
seconds, which I'm quite happy with.

This works well for fetching new mail, but we also want to propagate other
changes (e.g. marking mail as read), and make sure we're up to date at the
start, so for that I'll do the 'normal' thing and run ~mbsync -all~ every so often
--- let's say five minutes.

We can accomplish this via a systemd timer, and service file.
#+BEGIN_SRC systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/mbsync.timer
[Unit]
Description=call mbsync on all accounts every 5 minutes
ConditionPathExists=%h/.mbsyncrc

ConditionPathExists=%h/.mbsyncrc

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mbsync --all

#+END_SRC

Enabling (and starting) this is as simple as
#+BEGIN_SRC shell

#+END_SRC
*** Indexing/Searching
This is performed by [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][Mu]]. This is a tool for finding emails stored in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]] format.
According to the homepage, it's main features are
 + Fast indexing
 + Good searching
 + Support for encrypted and signed messages
 + Rich CLI tooling
 + accent/case normalisation
 + strong integration with email clients

Unfortunately ~mu~ is not currently packaged from me. Oh well, I guess I'm
building it from source then. I needed to install these packages
 + =gmime-devel=
 + =xapian-core-devel=

#+NAME: install mu from source (solus)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
cd ~/.local/lib/
git clone https://github.com/djcb/mu.git
cd ./mu
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

To check how my version compares to the latest published:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

*** User Interface/client
Webmail clients are nice and all, but I still don't believe that SPAs in my
browser can replaced desktop apps ... sorry Gmail. I'm also liking google less
and less.

Mailspring is a decent desktop client, quite lightweight for electron
(apparently the backend is in =C=, which probably helps), however I miss Emacs
stuff.

While =Notmuch= seems very promising, and I've heard good things about it, it
doesn't seem to make any changes to the emails themselves. All data is stored in
Notmuch's database. While this is a very interesting model, occasionally I need
to pull up an email on say my phone, and so not I want the tagging/folders etc.
to be applied to the mail itself --- not stored in a database.

On the other hand =Mu4e= is also talked about a lot in positive terms, and seems
to possess a similarly strong feature set --- and modifies the mail itself (I.e.
information is accessible without the database). =Mu4e= also seems to have a large
user base, which tends to correlate with better support and attention.

There are a few write-ups I could find useful on this
 + [[https://zmalltalker.com/linux/mu.html][Zmalltalker : Email done right]]
 + [[https://www.baty.net/2016/better-mu4e-message-rendering/][Better Mu4e Message Rendering - Jack Baty's weblog]]
*** Sending
[[https://www.nongnu.org/smtpmail/][SmtpMail]] seems to be the 'default' starting point, but that's not packaged for
me. [[https://marlam.de/msmtp/][msmtp]] is however, so I'll give that a shot. Reading around a bit (googling
"msmtp vs sendmail" for example) almost every comparison mentioned seems to
suggest msmtp to be a better choice. I have seen the following points raised
 + ~sendmail~ has several vulnerabilities
 + ~sendmail~ is tedious to configure
 + ~ssmtp~ is no longer maintained
 + ~msmtp~ is a maintained alternative to ~ssmtp~
 + ~msmtp~ is easier to configure

The config file is [[file:~/.msmtprc][~/.msmtprc]]

**** System hackery
Unfortunately, I seem to have run into a [[https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44994][bug]] present in my packaged version, so
we'll just install the latest from source.

For full use of the ~auth~ options, I need =GNU SASL=, which isn't packaged for me.
I don't think I want it, but in case I do, I'll need to do this.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no :tangle no

earlier on in my ~$PATH~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e")
#+END_SRC

We can register Emacs as a potential email client with the following desktop
file, thanks to Etienne Deparis's [[https://etienne.depar.is/emacs.d/mu4e.html][Mu4e customization]].
#+BEGIN_SRC conf :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/emacsmail.desktop

The main mu4e window is ... alright. I'm not afraid of unicode though, so I'll
define a fancier version. Look, it's the asterisks. We can do better than
asterisks. The keybindings can also be made nicer, why have ~[x]~ when we can just
have a bold, coloured ~x~. Does the same job, while looking much less garish.

I asked about this in a [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/238#issuecomment-586385773][GitHub Issue]], and the fix is to use the ~cmake~ flag

*** System config
Org mode isn't recognised as it's own mime type by default, but that can easily
be changed with the following file. For system-wide changes try
~~/usr/share/mime/packages/org.xml~.
#+BEGIN_SRC xml :tangle ~/.local/share/mime/packages/org.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>
  <mime-type type="text/org">
    <comment>Emacs Org-mode File</comment>
    <glob pattern="*.org"/>
    <alias type="text/org"/>
  </mime-type>
</mime-info>
#+END_SRC
What's nice is that Papirus [[https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/commit/a10fb7f2423d5e30b9c4477416ccdc93c4f3849d][now]] has an icon for =text/org=.
One simply needs to refresh their mime database
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
#+END_SRC
Then set Emacs as the default editor
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent
xdg-mime default emacs.desktop text/org
#+END_SRC
*** Behaviour

**** Tweaking defaults
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/.org"                      ; let's put files here
      org-use-property-inheritance t              ; it's convenient to have properties inherited
      org-log-done 'time                          ; having the time a item is done sounds convininet
      org-list-allow-alphabetical t               ; have a. A. a) A) list bullets
      org-export-in-background t                  ; run export processes in external emacs process
      org-catch-invisible-edits 'smart)           ; try not to accidently do weird stuff in invisible regions
#+END_SRC
I also like the ~:comments~ header-argument, so let's make that a default.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-default-header-args '((:session . "none")
                                      (:results . "replace")
                                      (:exports . "code")
                                      (:cache . "no")
                                      (:noweb . "no")
                                      (:hlines . "no")
                                      (:tangle . "no")
                                      (:comments . "link")))
#+END_SRC
By default, ~visual-line-mode~ is turned =on=, and ~auto-fill-mode~ =off= by a hook.
However this messes with tables in Org-mode, and other plaintext files (e.g.
markdown, \LaTeX) so I'll turn it off for this, and manually enable it for more
specific modes as desired.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'text-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)

**** Extra functionality
***** Org buffer creation
Let's also make creating an org buffer just that little bit easier.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(evil-define-command evil-buffer-org-new (count file)
  "Creates a new ORG buffer replacing the current window, optionally
   editing a certain FILE"
  :repeat nil
  (interactive "P<f>")
  (if file
      (evil-edit file)
    (let ((buffer (generate-new-buffer "*new org*")))
      (set-window-buffer nil buffer)
      (with-current-buffer buffer
        (org-mode)))))
(map! :leader
  (:prefix "b"
    :desc "New empty ORG buffer" "o" #'evil-buffer-org-new))
#+END_SRC
***** List bullet sequence
I think it makes sense to have list bullets change with depth
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-list-demote-modify-bullet '(("+" . "-") ("-" . "+") ("*" . "+")))
#+END_SRC
***** Citation
Occasionally I want to cite something.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-ref
   :after org
   :config
    (setq org-ref-completion-library 'org-ref-ivy-cite))
#+END_SRC
***** cdlatex
It's also nice to be able to use ~cdlatex~.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! org (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex))
#+END_SRC

It's handy to be able to quickly insert environments with =C-c }=. I almost always
want to edit them afterwards though, so let's make that happen by default.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(after! org
  (defadvice! org-edit-latex-emv-after-insert ()
    :after #'org-cdlatex-environment-indent
    (org-edit-latex-environment)))
#+END_SRC

At some point in the future it could be good to investigate [[https://scripter.co/splitting-an-org-block-into-two/][splitting org blocks]].
Likewise [[https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2020/insert-math-symbol-in-emacs/][this]] looks good for symbols.

   that there are entries following with keys like \"ab\", \"ax\"…

2. Select-able members must have more than two elements, with the first
   being the string of keys that lead to selecting it, and the second a
   short description string of the item.

The command will then make a temporary buffer listing all entries
that can be selected with a single key, and all the single key
prefixes.  When you press the key for a single-letter entry, it is selected.
When you press a prefix key, the commands (and maybe further prefixes)
under this key will be shown and offered for selection.

TITLE will be placed over the selection in the temporary buffer,

**** Org Plot
There are two main bits of extra functionality I wan to add
+ the ability to transpose tables (internally)
+ a radar type

To accomplish this, overriding the ~org-plot/gnuplot~ function seems to be the
clear way. I tried this, and overrode so much that it seemed to make sense
just to modify =org-plot.el= instead, as it was only ~350 lines and I functions
that encompassed most of that line count.

Given that my [[file:lisp/org-plot.el][org-plot.el]] is now ~700 lines, this seems to have been a good call.

For transposition, I've added the following (equivalent) keys
+ ~[transpose|t]~
+ ~t~
When set to ~yes~, ~y~, or ~t~ the table is internally transposed (i.e. the =elisp= data
form of the table only).

The radar chart is a lot more involved, and I've added the following keys
+ ~type:radar~
  This uses the radar template, the result of which can be seen in <<...>>
+ ~[min|ymin]:0..n~
  This sets the start value of /every/ axis.
+ ~[max|ymax]:0..n~
  This sets the end value of /every/ axis.
  If both ~ymin~ and ~ymax~ are set, only the first axis gets tick labels.
+ ~ticks:0..n~
  This sets the number of ticks. Only works for \(n>2\), or \(n=0\) in which
  case no ticks are shown.

We can either render from a ~dvi~ or ~pdf~ file, so let's benchmark ~latex~ and
~pdflatex~.
| ~latex~ time | ~pdflatex~ time |
|------------+---------------|
| 135±2 ms   | 215±3 ms      |

On the rendering side, there are two ~.dvi~-to-image converters which I am
interested in: ~dvipng~ and ~dvisvgm~. Then with the a ~.pdf~ we have ~pdf2svg~.
For inline preview we care about speed, while for exporting we care about file
size and prefer a vector graphic.

Using the above latex expression and benchmarking lead to the following results:
| ~dvipng~ time | ~dvisvgm~ time | ~pdf2svg~ time |
|-------------+--------------+--------------|
| 89±2 ms     | 178±2 ms     | 12±2 ms      |

Now let's combine this to see what's best
| Tool chain         | Total time | Resultant file size |
|--------------------+------------+---------------------|
| ~latex~ + ~dvipng~     | 226±2 ms   | 7 KiB               |
| ~latex~ + ~dvisvgm~    | 392±4 ms   | 8 KiB               |
| ~pdflatex~ + ~pdf2svg~ | 230±2 ms   | 16 KiB              |

So, let's use ~dvipng~ for previewing LaTeX fragments in-Emacs, but ~dvisvgm~ for [[
Exporting to HTML][LaTeX Rendering]].
/Unfortunately: it seems that svg sizing is annoying ATM, so let's actually not do this right now./

As well as having a sans font, there are a few other tweaks which can make them
look better. Namely making sure that the colours switch when the theme does.

** hledger
~ledger-mode~ is great and all, but ~hledger~ seems to be more actively maintained.
For example, from 2018--2020, the most prolific contributor to ~ledger~ produced
31 commits. For ~hledger~ this statistic is 1800 commits. In addition, over the
last decade, ~ledger~ seems to have lost steam, while ~hledger~ seems as actively
developed as ever. From this basic comparison ~hledger~ looks to have a more
promising outlook. It also has a few extra niceties that ~ledger~ doesn't, but is
a little slower (~haskell~ vs. ~c++~).
Since this uses the same format, and ~ledger-mode~ is well integrated into emacs,
and produced by John Wiegley --- author of ~ledger~ and current Emacs maintainer
--- using this seems like a good idea. Thankfully we can, with a little modification.

will do it's own line wrapping, hence we /only/ want to use visual line wrapping. No hard stuff.

Since markdown is often seen as rendered HTML, let's try to somewhat mirror the
style or markdown renderes.

Most markdown renders seem to make the first three headings levels larger than
normal text, the first two much so. Then the fourth level tends to be the same
as body text, while the fifth and sixth are (increasingly) smaller, with the
sixth greyed out. Since the sixth level is so small, I'll turn up the boldness a notch.
