* Intro
Customising an editor can be very rewarding ... until you have to leave it.
For years I have been looking for ways to avoid this pain.
Then I discovered [[https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere][vim-anywhere]], and found that it had an Emacs companion,
[[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere][emacs-anywhere]]. To me, this looked most attractive.

Separately, online I have seen the following statement enough times I think it's a catchphrase
#+begin_quote
Redditor 1: I just discovered this thing, isn't it cool. \\
Redditor 2: Oh, there's an Emacs mode for that.
#+end_quote

This was enough for me to install Emacs, but I soon learned there are [[https://github.com/remacs/remacs#why-emacs][far more
compelling reasons]] to keep using it.

I tried out the =spacemacs= distribution a bit, but it wasn't quite to my liking.
Then I heard about =doom emacs= and thought I may as well give that a try.
TLDR; it's great.

Now I've discovered the wonders of literate programming, and am becoming more
settled by the day. This is both my config, and a cautionary tale (just replace
"Linux" with "Emacs" in the comic below).

[[xkcd:456]]

** Why Emacs?

Emacs is [[https://www.eigenbahn.com/2020/01/12/emacs-is-no-editor][not a text editor]], this is a common misnomer. It is far more apt to
describe Emacs as /a Lisp machine providing a generic user-centric text
manipulation environment/. That's quite a mouthful.
In simpler terms one can think of Emacs as a platform for text-related
applications. It's a vague and generic definition because Emacs itself is
generic.

Good with text. How far does that go? A lot further than one initially thinks:
+ [[https://orgmode.org/][Task planning]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][File management]]
+ [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][Terminal emulation]]
+ [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][Email client]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][Remote server tool]]
+ [[https://magit.vc/][Git frontend]]
+ Web [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][client]]/[[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][server]]
+ and more...

Ideally, one may use Emacs as /the/ interface to perform =input → transform →
output= cycles, i.e. form a bridge between the human mind and information
manipulation.

*** The enveloping editor
Emacs allows one to do more in one place than any other application. Why is this
good?
+ Enables one to complete tasks with a consistent, standard set of keybindings,
  GUI and editing methods --- learn once, use everywhere
+ Reduced context-switching
+ Compressing the stages of a project --- a more centralised workflow can progress
  with greater ease
+ Integration between tasks previously relegated to different applications, but
  with a common subject --- e.g. linking to an email in a to-do list

Emacs can be thought of as a platform within which various elements of your
workflow may settle, with the potential for rich integrations between them --- a
/life/ IDE if you will.

Today, many aspects of daily computer usage are split between different
applications which act like islands, but this often doesn't mirror how we
/actually use/ our computers. Emacs, if one goes down the rabbit hole, can give
users the power to bridge this gap.

*** Some notably unique features
+ Recursive editing
+ Completely introspectable, with pervasive docstrings
+ Mutable environment, which can be incrementally modified
+ Functionality without applications
+ Client-server separation allows for a daemon, giving near-instant perceived
  startup time.

*** Issues
+ Emacs has irritating quirks
+ Some aspects are showing their age (naming conventions, APIs)
+ Emacs is ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Threads.html][mostly]]) single-threaded, meaning that when something holds that
  thread up the whole application freezes
+ A few other nuisances

*** Teach a man to fish...
#+begin_quote
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed
him for a lifetime. --- Anne Isabella
#+end_quote

Most popular editors have a simple and pretty [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings][settings interface]], filled with
check-boxes, selects, and the occasional text-box. This makes it easy for the
user to pick between common desirable behaviours. To me this is now like /giving
a man a fish/.

What if you want one of those 'check-box' settings to be only on in certain
conditions? Some editors have workspace settings, but that requires you to
manually set the value for /every single instance/. Urgh, [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/93153][what]] [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/93628][a]] [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/5595][pain]].

What if you could set the value of that 'check-box' setting to be the result of
an arbitrary expression evaluated for each file? This is where an editor like
Emacs comes in.
Configuration for Emacs isn't a list of settings in JSON etc. it's *an executable
program which modifies the behaviour of the editor to suit your liking*.
This is 'teaching a man to fish'.

Emacs is built in the same language you configure it in (Emacs [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]], or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/][elisp]]).
It comes with a broad array of useful functions for text-editing, and Doom adds
a few handy little convenience functions.

Want to add a keybinding to delete the previous line? It's as easy as
#+name: Keybinding to delete the previous line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(map! "C-d"
      (cmd! (previous-line)
            (kill-line)
            (forward-line)))
#+end_src

How about another example, say you want to be presented with a list of currently
open /buffers/ (think files, almost) when you split the window. It's as simple as
#+name: Prompt for buffer after split
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after 'window-split (switch-to-buffer))
#+end_src

Want to test it out? You don't need to save and restart, you can just /evaluate
the expression/ within your current Emacs instance and try it immediately! This
editor is, after all, a Lisp interpreter.

Want to tweak the behaviour? Just re-evaluate your new version --- it's a
super-tight iteration loop.

** Editor comparison

[[xkcd:378]]

Over the years I have tried out (spent at least a year using as my primary
editor) the following applications
- Python IDLE
- Komodo Edit
- Brackets
- ;VSCode
- and now, Emacs

I have attempted to quantify aspects of my impressions of them below.

#+plot: transpose:yes type:radar min:0 max:4 ticks:4 file:"misc/editor-comparison.png"

** Notes for the unwary adventurer
If you like the look of this, that's marvellous, and I'm really happy that I've
made something which you may find interesting, however:
#+begin_warning
This config is /insidious/. Copying the whole thing blindly can easily lead to
undesired effects. I recommend copying chunks instead.
#+end_warning

If you are so bold as to wish to steal bits of my config (or if I upgrade and
wonder why things aren't working), here's a list of sections which rely on
external setup (i.e. outside of this config).

+ dictionary :: I've downloaded a custom [[http://app.aspell.com/create][SCOWL]] dictionary, which I use in [[*Ispell][ispell]].
  If this causes issues, just delete the ~(setq ispell-dictionary ...)~ bit.
+ uni-units file :: I've got a file in =~/.org/.uni-units= which I use in ~org-capture~
  If this causes issues, just remove the reference to that file in [[*Capture][Capture]] and
  instances of ~unit-prompt~ used in  ~(doct ...)~

Oh, did I mention that I started this config when I didn't know any =elisp=, and
this whole thing is a hack job? If you can suggest any improvements, please do
so, no matter how much criticism you include I'll appreciate it :)

[[xkcd:1513]]

*** Extra Requirements
The lovely ~doom doctor~ is good at diagnosing most missing things, but here are a
few extras.
+ A [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][LaTeX Compiler]] is required for the mathematics rendering performed in [[#org][Org]],
  and by [[*CalcTeX][CalcTeX]].
+ I use the [[https://overpassfont.org/][Overpass]] font as a go-to sans serif.
  It's used as my ~doom-variable-pitch-font~ and in the graph generated by [[*Roam][Roam]].
  I have chosen it because it possesses a few characteristics I consider
  desirable, namely:
  - A clean, and legible style. Highway-style fonts tend to be designed to be
    clear at a glance, and work well with a thicker weight, and this is inspired
    by /Highway Gothic/.
  - It's slightly quirky. Look at the diagonal cut on stems for example.
    Helvetica is a masterful design, but I like a bit more pizzazz now and then.
+ A few LSP servers. Take a look at [[file:init.el][init.el]] to see which modules have the ~+lsp~ flag.
+ The [[https://github.com/dandavison/delta/][Delta]] binary. It's packaged for some distributions but I installed it with
  #+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "delta") "no" "setup.sh")
cargo install git-delta
  #+end_src
+ The =theme-magic= package requires the ~wal~ (=pywal=) executable. If this is
  packaged for you, great! If not, it's just a quick ~pip install~ away.
  #+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "wal") "no" "setup.sh")
sudo python3 -m pip install pywal
  #+end_src

** Current Issues
*** Magit push in daemon
Quite often trying to push to a remote in the Emacs daemon produces as error like this:
#+begin_src fundamental
128 git … push -v origin refs/heads/master\:refs/heads/master
Pushing to git@github.com:tecosaur/emacs-config.git

fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
#+end_src
*** Unread emails doesn't work across Emacs instances
It would be nice if it did, so that I could have the Emacs-daemon hold the
active mu4e session, but still get that information. In this case I'd want to
change the action to open the Emacs daemon, but it should be possible.

This would probably involve hooking into the daemon's modeline update function
to write to a temporary file, and having a file watcher started in other Emacs
instances, in a similar manner to [[*Rebuild mail index while using mu4e][Rebuild mail index while using mu4e]].

* Rudimentary configuration
Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]]
for more info).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :comments no
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :exports none :comments no :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
#!/bin/bash
#+end_src
** Personal Information
It's useful to have some basic personal information
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "TEC"
      user-mail-address "tec@tecosaur.com")
#+end_src
Apparently this is used by ~GPG~, and all sorts of other things.

Speaking of ~GPG~, I want to use =~/.authsource.gpg= instead of the default in
=~/.emacs.d=. Why? Because my home directory is already cluttered, so this won't
make a difference, and I don't want to accidentaly purge this file (I have done
~rm -rf~/.emac.d~ before). I also want to cache as much as possible, as my home
machine is pretty safe, and my laptop is shutdown a lot.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg")
      auth-source-cache-expiry nil) ; default is 7200 (2h)
#+end_src
** Better defaults
*** Simple settings
Browsing the web and seeing [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]] and comparing with the values
shown by =SPC h v= and selecting what I thought looks good, I've ended up adding the following:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't
      truncate-string-ellipsis "…")               ; Unicode ellispis are nicer than "...", and also save /precious/ space

(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line

(if (equal "Battery status not available"
           (battery))
    (display-battery-mode 1)                        ; On laptops it's nice to know how much power you have
  (setq password-cache-expiry nil))               ; I can trust my desktops ... can't I? (no battery = desktop)

(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words
#+end_src
*** Frame sizing
It's nice to control the size of new frames, when launching Emacs that can be
done with ~emacs -geometry 160x48~. After the font size adjustment during
initialisation this works out to be ~102x31~.

Thanks to hotkeys, it's easy for me to expand a frame to half/full-screen, so it
makes sense to be conservative with the sizing of new frames.

Then, for creating new frames within the same Emacs instance, we'll just set the
default to be something roughly 80% of that size.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 24))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 80))
#+end_src
*** Auto-customisations
By default changes made via a customisation interface are added to =init.el=.
I prefer the idea of using a separate file for this. We just need to change a
setting, and load it if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" doom-private-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+end_src
*** Windows
I find it rather handy to be asked which buffer I want to see after splitting
the window. Let's make that happen.
First, we'll enter the new window
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src
Then, we'll pull up ~ivy~
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (+ivy/switch-buffer))
#+end_src
Oh, and previews are nice
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +ivy-buffer-preview t)
#+end_src

Window rotation is nice, and can be found under =SPC w r= and =SPC w R=.
/Layout/ rotation is also nice though. Let's stash this under =SPC w SPC=, inspired
by Tmux's use of =C-b SPC= to rotate windows.

We could also do with adding the missing arrow-key variants of the window
navigation/swapping commands.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-window-map
      "SPC" #'rotate-layout
      ;; Navigation
      "<left>"     #'evil-window-left
      "<down>"     #'evil-window-down
      "<up>"       #'evil-window-up
      "<right>"    #'evil-window-right
      ;; Swapping windows
      "C-<left>"       #'+evil/window-move-left
      "C-<down>"       #'+evil/window-move-down
      "C-<up>"         #'+evil/window-move-up
      "C-<right>"      #'+evil/window-move-right)
#+end_src
*** Buffer defaults
I'd much rather have my new buffers in ~org-mode~ than ~fundamental-mode~, hence
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src
For some reason this + the mixed pitch hook causes issues with hydra and so I'll
just need to resort to =SPC b o= for now.
** Doom configuration
*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
Doom has this lovely /modular configuration base/ that takes a lot of work out of
configuring Emacs. Each module (when enabled) can provide a list of packages to
install (on ~doom sync~) and configuration to be applied. The modules can also
have flags applied to tweak their behaviour.

#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el" :noweb no-export :comments none
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

**** Structure
As you may have noticed by this point, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration. Doom
has good support for this which we access though the ~literate~ module.

While we're in the ~:config~ section, we'll use Dooms nicer defaults, along with
the bindings and smartparens behaviour (the flags aren't documented, but they exist).
#+name: doom-config
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(default +bindings +smartparens)
#+end_src

**** Interface
There's a lot that can be done to enhance Emacs' capabilities.
I reckon enabling half the modules Doom provides should do it.

**** Everything in Emacs
It's just too convenient being able to have everything in Emacs.
I couldn't resist the Email and Feed modules.

*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face
'Fira Code' is nice, and 'Overpass' makes for a nice sans companion. We just need to
fiddle with the font sizes a tad so that they visually match. Just for fun I'm
trying out JetBrains Mono though. So far I have mixed feelings on it, some
aspects are nice, but on others I prefer Fira.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :size 24)
      doom-big-font (font-spec :family "JetBrains Mono" :size 36)
      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Overpass" :size 24)
      doom-serif-font (font-spec :family "IBM Plex Mono" :weight 'light))
#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Screenshot of the fonts within Emacs.

**** Theme and modeline
~doom-one~ is nice and all, but I find the ~vibrant~ variant nicer. Oh, and with the
nice selection doom provides there's no reason for me to want the defaults.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-vibrant)
(delq! t custom-theme-load-path)
#+end_src
However, by default ~red~ text is used in the ~modeline~, so let's make that orange
so I don't feel like something's gone /wrong/ when editing files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+end_src
While we're modifying the modeline, =LF UTF-8= is the default file encoding, and
thus not worth noting in the modeline. So, let's conditionally hide it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (and (memq (plist-get (coding-system-plist buffer-file-coding-system) :category)
                                 '(coding-category-undecided coding-category-utf-8))
                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))

(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+end_src
**** Miscellaneous
Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src
I'd like some slightly nicer default buffer names
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+end_src
There's a bug with the modeline in insert mode for org documents ([[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline/issues/300][issue]]), so
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces! '(doom-modeline-evil-insert-state :weight bold :foreground "#339CDB"))
#+end_src
*** Some helper macros
There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~Emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map!~ for binding new keys
** Other things
*** Editor interaction
**** Mouse buttons
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
#+end_src
*** Window title
I'd like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled =config.org ●
doom= then as soon as I make a change it will become =config.org ◉ doom=.
*** Splash screen
Emacs can render an image as the splash screen, and [[https://github.com/MarioRicalde][@MarioRicalde]] came up with a
cracker! He's also provided me with a nice Emacs-style /E/, which is good for
smaller windows. *@MarioRicalde* you have my sincere thanks, you're great!

*** Systemd daemon
For running a systemd service for a Emacs server I have the following
#+name: emacsclient service
#+begin_src systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/emacs.service :mkdirp yes
[Unit]
Description=Emacs server daemon
Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=sh -c 'emacs --daemon && emacsclient -c --eval "(delete-frame)"'
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --no-wait --eval "(progn (setq kill-emacs-hook nil) (kill emacs))"
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+end_src

which is then enabled by
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= "enabled\n" (shell-command-to-string "systemctl --user is-enabled emacs.service")) "no" "setup.sh")
systemctl --user enable emacs.service
#+end_src

For some reason if a frame isn't opened early in the initialisation process, the
daemon doesn't seem to like opening frames later --- hence the ~&& emacsclient~
part of the =ExecStart= value.

It can now be nice to use this as a 'default app' for opening files. If we add
an appropriate desktop entry, and enable it in the desktop environment.

#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/emacs-client.desktop :mkdirp yes

#+end_src

When the daemon is running, I almost always want to do a few particular things
with it, so I may as well eat the load time at startup. We also want to keep
=mu4e= running.

It would be good to start the IRC client (=circe=) too, but that seems to have
issues when started in a non-graphical session.

#+name: daemon initialisation

*** Emacs client wrapper
I frequently want to make use of Emacs while in a terminal emulator. To make
this easier, I can construct a few handy aliases.

However, a little convenience script in =~/.local/bin= can have the same effect,
be available beyond the specific shell I plop the alias in, then also allow me
to add a few bells and whistles --- namely:
+ Accepting stdin by putting it in a temporary file and immediately opening it.
+ Guessing that the =tty= is a good idea when ~$DISPLAY~ is unset (relevant with SSH
  sessions, among other things).
+ With a whiff of 24-bit color support, sets ~TERM~ variable to a =terminfo= that
  (probably) announces 24-bit color support.
+ Changes GUI =emacsclient= instances to be non-blocking by default (~--no-wait~),
  and instead take a flag to suppress this behaviour (~-w~).

I would use =sh=, but using arrays for argument manipulation is just too
convenient, so I'll raise the requirement to =bash=. Since arrays are the only
'extra' compared to =sh=, other shells like =csh= etc. should work too.

This is where you install packages, by declaring them with the ~package!~
macro, then running ~doom refresh~ on the command line. You'll need to
restart Emacs for your changes to take effect! Or at least, run =M-x doom/reload=.

WARNING: Don't disable core packages listed in ~~/.emacs.d/core/packages.el~.
Doom requires these, and disabling them may have terrible side effects.

*** Packages in MELPA/ELPA/emacsmirror
To install ~some-package~ from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! some-package)
#+end_src

*** Packages from git repositories
To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
a ~:recipe~. You'll find documentation on what ~:recipe~ accepts [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format][here]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! another-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+end_src

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a ~PACKAGENAME.el~
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+end_src

*** Disabling built-in packages
If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
you can do so here with the ~:disable~ property:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src
You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+end_src

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
our package manager can't deal with; see [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/issues/279][raxod502/straight.el#279]])
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+end_src
** General packages

Hey, let's get the weather in here while we're at it.
Unfortunately this seems slightly unmaintained ([[https://github.com/bcbcarl/emacs-wttrin/pulls][few open bugfix PRs]]) so let's

For some reason, I find myself demoing Emacs every now and then. Showing what
keyboard stuff I'm doing on-screen seems helpful. While [[https://gitlab.com/screenkey/screenkey][screenkey]] does exist,
having something that doesn't cover up screen content is nice.

In a similar manner, [[https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/emacs-gif-screencast][gif-screencast]] may come in handy.

We can lazy load this using the start/stop commands.

I initially installed ~scrot~ for this, since it was the default capture program.
However it raised ~glib error: Saving to file ... failed~ each time it was run.
Google didn't reveal any easy fixed, so I switched to [[https://github.com/naelstrof/maim][maim]]. We now need to pass
it the window ID. This doesn't change throughout the lifetime of an emacs
instance, so as long as a single window is used ~xdotool getactivewindow~ will
give a satisfactory result.

It seems that when new colours appear, that tends to make ~gifsicle~ introduce
artefacts. To avoid this we pre-populate the colour map using the current doom
theme.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

**** Definitions
Doom already loads =define-word=, and provides it's own definition service using
[[https://github.com/gromnitsky/wordnut][wordnut]]. However, using an offline dictionary possess a few compelling
advantages, namely:
+ speed
+ integration of multiple dictionaries
[[http://goldendict.org/][GoldenDict]] seems like the best option currently avalible, but lacks a CLI.
Hence, we'll fall back to [[https://dushistov.github.io/sdcv/][sdcv]] (a CLI version of StarDict) for now.
To interface with this, we'll use a my =lexic= package.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Screenshot of the lexic-mode view of "literate"
[[https://tecosaur.com/lfs/emacs-config/screenshots/lexic.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! lexic :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/lexic"))
#+end_src

Given that a request for a CLI is the most upvoted issue on GitHub for
GoldenDict, it's likely we'll be able to switch from ~sdcv~ to that in the future.

Since GoldenDict supports StarDict files, I expect this will be a relatively
painless switch.
**** Calibre and ebook reading
For managing my ebooks, I'll hook into the well-established ebook library
manager [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][calibre]]. A number of Emacs clients for this exist, but this seems like a
good option.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! calibredb :pin "1f38fc34a8c159846450d18b1ee50cc960349ee7")
#+end_src

Then for reading them, the only currently viable options seems to be [[https://depp.brause.cc/nov.el/][nov.el]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! nov :pin "0ece7ccbf79c074a3e4fbad1d1fa06647093f8e4")
#+end_src

Together these should give me a rather good experience reading ebooks.
**** Screenshots
This makes it a breeze to take lovely screenshots.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Example screenshot.el screenshot

Org tables aren't the prettiest thing to look at. This package is supposed to

**** Extra functionality
Because of the /[[https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/markdown-flavors][lovely variety in markdown implementations]]/ there isn't actually
such a thing a standard table spec ... or standard anything really. Because
~org-md~ is a goody-two-shoes, it just uses HTML for all these non-standardised
elements (a lot of them). So ~ox-gfm~ is handy for exporting markdown with all the
features that GitHub has.

*** CalcTeX

We'd like to use CalcTeX too, so let's set that up, and fix some glaring
inadequacies --- why on earth would you commit a hard-coded path to an executable
that /only works on your local machine/, consequently breaking the package for
everyone else!?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Embedded calc

Embedded calc is a lovely feature which let's us use calc to operate on LaTeX
maths expressions. The standard keybinding is a bit janky however (=C-x * e=), so
we'll add a localleader-based alternative.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map calc-mode-map
      :after calc
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :after org
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "E" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map latex-mode-map
      :after latex
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
#+end_src

Unfortunately this operates without the (rather informative) calculator and
trail buffers, but we can advice it that we would rather like those in a side
panel.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar calc-embedded-trail-window nil)
(defvar calc-embedded-calculator-window nil)

(defadvice! calc-embedded-with-side-pannel (&rest _)
  :after #'calc-do-embedded
  (when calc-embedded-trail-window
    (ignore-errors
      (delete-window calc-embedded-trail-window))
    (setq calc-embedded-trail-window nil))
  (when calc-embedded-calculator-window
    (ignore-errors
      (delete-window calc-embedded-calculator-window))
    (setq calc-embedded-calculator-window nil))
  (when (and calc-embedded-info
             (> (* (window-width) (window-height)) 1200))
    (let ((main-window (selected-window))
          (vertical-p (> (window-width) 80)))
      (select-window
       (setq calc-embedded-trail-window
             (if vertical-p
                 (split-window-horizontally (- (max 30 (/ (window-width) 3))))
               (split-window-vertically (- (max 8 (/ (window-height) 4)))))))
      (switch-to-buffer "*Calc Trail*")
      (select-window
       (setq calc-embedded-calculator-window
             (if vertical-p
                 (split-window-vertically -6)
               (split-window-horizontally (- (/ (window-width) 2))))))

#+end_src

** Centaur Tabs
We want to make the tabs a nice, comfy size (~36~), with icons. The modifier
marker is nice, but the particular default Unicode one causes a lag spike, so
let's just switch to an ~o~, which still looks decent but doesn't cause any
issues.
A 'active-bar' is nice, so let's have one of those. If we have it ~under~ needs us to
turn on ~x-underline-at-decent~ though. For some reason this didn't seem to work
inside the ~(after! ... )~ block ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
Then let's change the font to a sans serif, but the default one doesn't fit too
well somehow, so let's switch to 'P22 Underground Book'; it looks much nicer.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! centaur-tabs
  (centaur-tabs-mode -1)
  (setq centaur-tabs-height 36
        centaur-tabs-set-icons t

        centaur-tabs-close-button "×"

;; (setq x-underline-at-descent-line t)
#+end_src
** Company
It's nice to have completions almost all the time, in my opinion. Key strokes
are just waiting to be saved!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! company
  (setq company-idle-delay 0.5
        company-minimum-prefix-length 2)
  (setq company-show-numbers t)
  (add-hook 'evil-normal-state-entry-hook #'company-abort)) ;; make aborting less annoying.
#+end_src
Now, the improvements from ~precedent~ are mostly from remembering history, so
let's improve that memory.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default history-length 1000)
(setq-default prescient-history-length 1000)
#+end_src
*** Plain Text
~Ispell~ is nice, let's have it in ~text~, ~markdown~, and ~GFM~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-company-backend!
  '(text-mode
    markdown-mode
    gfm-mode)
  '(:seperate
    company-ispell
    company-files
    company-yasnippet))
#+end_src
We then configure the dictionary we're using in [[*Ispell][Ispell]].
*** ESS
~company-dabbrev-code~ is nice. Let's have it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Emojify

For starters, twitter's emojis look nicer than emoji-one.
Other than that, this is pretty great OOTB.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq emojify-emoji-set "twemoji-v2")
#+end_src

One minor annoyance is the use of emojis over the default character
when the default is actually preferred. This occurs with overlay symbols I use
in Org mode, such as checkbox state, and a few other miscellaneous cases.

We can accommodate our preferences by deleting those entries from the emoji hash
table

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar emojify-disabled-emojis
  '(;; Org
    "◼" "☑" "☸" "⚙" "⏩" "⏪" "⬆" "⬇" "❓"
    ;; Terminal powerline
    "✔"
    ;; Box drawing
    "▶" "◀")
  "Charachters that should never be affected by `emojify-mode'.")

(defadvice! emojify-delete-from-data ()
  "Ensure `emojify-disabled-emojis' don't appear in `emojify-emojis'."
  :after #'emojify-set-emoji-data
  (dolist (emoji emojify-disabled-emojis)
    (remhash emoji emojify-emojis)))
#+end_src

#+end_src

This new minor mode of ours will be nice for messages, so let's hook it in for
Email and IRC.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

** Eros-eval

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
** EVIL
I don't use ~evil-escape-mode~, so I may as well turn it off, I've heard it
contributes a typing delay. I'm not sure it's much, but it is an extra
~pre-command-hook~ that I don't benefit from, so...
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil-escape (evil-escape-mode -1))
#+end_src

When I want to make a substitution, I want it to be global more often than not

Oh, and by the way, if ~company-ispell-dictionary~ is ~nil~, then
~ispell-complete-word-dict~ is used instead, which once again when ~nil~ is
~ispell-alternate-dictionary~, which at the moment maps to a plaintext version of
the above.

It seems reasonable to want to keep an eye on my personal dict, let's have it

** Ivy
While in an ivy mini-buffer =C-o= shows a list of all possible actions one may take.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

I currently have ~40k functions. This seems like sufficient motivation to

Magit is pretty nice by default. The diffs don't get any

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Unfortunately this seems to mess things up, which is something I'll want to look

Loading after org seems a bit premature. Let's just load it when we try to use
it, either by command or in a capture template.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Projectile
Looking at documentation via =SPC h f= and =SPC h v= and looking at the source can
add package src directories to projectile. This isn't desirable in my opinion.

** Theme magic
Let's automatically update terminals on theme change (as long as ~pywal~ is available).

Unfortunately, as the theme is set on startup this causes the hook to be run
immediately. It would be nicer to /not/ have this add to our precious startup
time (around 0.4s last time I checked).
We can achieve this by deferring it with a short idle timer that should add the
hook /just after/ initialisation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "wal") "yes" "no")

*** Guix

** IRC
=circe= is a client for IRC in Emacs (hey, isn't that a nice project
name+acronym), and a greek enchantress who turned humans into animals.

Let's use the former to chat to +recluses+ discerning individuals online.

[[xkcd:1782]]

Before we start seeing and sending messages, we need to authenticate with our
IRC servers. The circe manual provided a snippet for putting some of the auth
details in =.authinfo.gpg= --- but I think we should go further than that: have
the entire server info in our authinfo.

First, a reasonable format by which we can specify:
+ server
+ port
+ SASL username
+ SASL password
+ channels to join

We can have these stored like so
#+begin_src authinfo
machine chat.freenode.net login USERNAME password PASSWORD port PORT for irc channels emacs,org-mode
#+end_src

The ~for irc~ bit is used so we can uniquely identify all IRC auth info. By
omitting the =#= in channel names we can have a list of channels comma-separated
(no space!) which the secrets API will return as a single string.

#+name: irc-authinfo-reader
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defun auth-server-pass (server)
  (if-let ((secret (plist-get (car (auth-source-search :host server)) :secret)))
      (if (functionp secret)
          (funcall secret) secret)
    (error "Could not fetch password for host %s" server)))

(defun register-irc-auths ()
  (require 'circe)
  (require 'dash)
  (let ((accounts (-filter (lambda (a) (string= "irc" (plist-get a :for)))
                           (auth-source-search :require '(:for) :max 10))))
    (appendq! circe-network-options
              (mapcar (lambda (entry)
                        (let* ((host (plist-get entry :host))
                               (label (or (plist-get entry :label) host))
                               (_ports (mapcar #'string-to-number
                                               (s-split "," (plist-get entry :port))))
                               (port (if (= 1 (length _ports)) (car _ports) _ports))
                               (user (plist-get entry :user))
                               (nick (or (plist-get entry :nick) user))
                               (channels (mapcar (lambda (c) (concat "#" c))
                                                 (s-split "," (plist-get entry :channels)))))
                          `(,label
                            :host ,host :port ,port :nick ,nick

** Newsfeed
RSS feeds are still a thing. Why not make use of them with =elfeed=.
I really like what [[https://github.com/fuxialexander/doom-emacs-private-xfu/tree/master/modules/app/rss][fuxialexander]] has going on, but I don't think I need a custom
module. Let's just try to patch on the main things I like the look of.

        :n "N" (cmd! (lexic-next-entry t))
        :n "p" #'lexic-previous-entry
        :n "P" (cmd! (lexic-previous-entry t))
        :n "E" (cmd! (lexic-return-from-lexic) ; expand
                     (switch-to-buffer (lexic-get-buffer)))
        :n "M" (cmd! (lexic-return-from-lexic) ; minimise

** Mail
[[xkcd:1467]]

*** Fetching
The contenders for this seem to be:
+ [[https://www.offlineimap.org/][OfflineIMAP]] ([[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OfflineIMAP][ArchWiki page]])
+ [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html][isync/mbsync]] ([[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/isync][ArchWiki page]])

From perusing r/emacs the prevailing opinion seems to be that
+ isync is faster
+ isync works more reliably
So let's use that.

The config was straightforward, and is located at [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]].
I'm currently successfully connecting to: Gmail, office365mail, and dovecot.
I'm also shoving passwords in my [[file:~/.authinfo.gpg][authinfo.gpg]] and fetching them using ~PassCmd~:
#+begin_src shell :tangle no :eval no
gpg2 -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d ~/.authinfo.gpg | awk '/machine IMAP_SERCER login EMAIL_ADDR/ {print $NF}'
#+end_src

We can run ~mbsync -a~ in a systemd service file or something, but we can do
better than that. [[https://github.com/vsemyonoff/easymail#usage][vsemyonoff/easymail]] seems like the sort of thing we want, but
is written for =notmuch= unfortunately. We can still use it for inspiration though.
Using [[https://gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify][goimapnotify]] we should be able to sync just after new
mail. Unfortunately this means /yet another/ config file :(

We install with
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "goimapnotify") "no" "setup.sh")
go get -u gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify
ln -s ~/.local/share/go/bin/goimapnotify ~/.local/bin/
#+end_src

Here's the general plan:
1. Use ~goimapnotify~ to monitor mailboxes
   This needs it's own set of configs, and =systemd= services, which is a pain. We
   remove this pain by writing a python script (found below) to setup these
   config files, and systemd services by parsing the  [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]] file.
2. On new mail, call ~mbsync --pull --new ACCOUNT:BOX~
   We try to be as specific as possible, so ~mbsync~ returns as soon as possible,
   and we can /get those emails as soon as possible/.
3. Try to call ~mu index --lazy-fetch~.
   This fails if mu4e is already open (due to a write lock on the database), so
   in that case we just ~touch~ a tmp file (=/tmp/mu_reindex_now=).
4. Separately, we set up Emacs to check for the existance of
   =/tmp/mu_reindex_now= once a second while mu4e is
   running, and (after deleting the file) call ~mu4e-update-index~.

Let's start off by handling the elisp side of things

**** Config transcoding & service management
As long as the =mbsyncrc= file exists, this is as easy as running
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (file-exists-p "~/.config/imapnotify") "no" "setup.sh")
~/.config/doom/misc/mbsync-imapnotify.py
#+end_src

When run without flags this will perform the following actions
+ Read, and parse [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]], specifically recognising the following properties
  - ~IMAPAccount~
  - ~Host~
  - ~Port~
  - ~User~
  - ~Password~
  - ~PassCmd~
  - ~Patterns~
+ Call ~mbsync --list ACCOUNT~, and filter results according to ~Patterns~
+ Construct a imapnotify config for each account, with the following hooks
  - onNewMail :: ~mbsync --pull ACCOUNT:MAILBOX~
  - onNewMailPost :: ~if mu index --lazy-check; then test -f /tmp/mu_reindex_now && rm /tmp/mu_reindex_now; else touch /tmp/mu_reindex_now; fi~
+ Compare accounts list to previous accounts, enable/disable the relevant
  systemd services, called with the ~--now~ flag (start/stop services as well)

This script also supports the following flags
+ ~--status~ to get the status of the relevant systemd services supports =active=,
  =failing=, and =disabled=
+ ~--enable~ to enable all relevant systemd services
+ ~--disable~ to disable all relevant systemd services

**** Systemd
We then have a service file to run ~goimapnotify~ on all of these generated config files.
We'll use a template service file so we can enable a unit per-account.
#+begin_src systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/goimapnotify@.service

#+end_src

Enabling the service is actually taken care of by that python script.

From one or two small tests, this can bring the delay down to as low as five
seconds, which I'm quite happy with.

This works well for fetching new mail, but we also want to propagate other
changes (e.g. marking mail as read), and make sure we're up to date at the
start, so for that I'll do the 'normal' thing and run ~mbsync -all~ every so often
--- let's say five minutes.

We can accomplish this via a systemd timer, and service file.
#+begin_src systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/mbsync.timer
[Unit]
Description=call mbsync on all accounts every 5 minutes
ConditionPathExists=%h/.mbsyncrc

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mbsync -c %h/.mbsyncrc --all

[Install]
WantedBy=mail.target
#+end_src

Enabling (and starting) this is as simple as
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= "enabled\n" (shell-command-to-string "systemctl --user is-enabled mbsync.timer")) "no" "setup.sh")
systemctl --user enable mbsync.timer --now
#+end_src
*** Indexing/Searching
This is performed by [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][Mu]]. This is a tool for finding emails stored in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]] format.
According to the homepage, it's main features are
+ Fast indexing
+ Good searching
+ Support for encrypted and signed messages
+ Rich CLI tooling
+ accent/case normalisation
+ strong integration with email clients

Unfortunately ~mu~ is not currently packaged from me. Oh well, I guess I'm
building it from source then. I needed to install these packages
+ =gmime-devel=
+ =xapian-core-devel=

#+name: Install mu from source
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "mu") "no" "setup.sh")
cd ~/.local/lib/
git clone https://github.com/djcb/mu.git
cd ./mu
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
#+end_src

To check how my version compares to the latest published:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/djcb/mu/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/'
mu --version | head -n 1 | sed 's/.* version //'
#+end_src

#+results:
| 1.4.6 |

*** Sending
[[https://www.nongnu.org/smtpmail/][SmtpMail]] seems to be the 'default' starting point, but that's not packaged for
me. [[https://marlam.de/msmtp/][msmtp]] is however, so I'll give that a shot. Reading around a bit (googling
"msmtp vs sendmail" for example) almost every comparison mentioned seems to
suggest msmtp to be a better choice. I have seen the following points raised
+ ~sendmail~ has several vulnerabilities
+ ~sendmail~ is tedious to configure
+ ~ssmtp~ is no longer maintained
+ ~msmtp~ is a maintained alternative to ~ssmtp~
+ ~msmtp~ is easier to configure

The config file is [[file:~/.msmtprc][~/.msmtprc]]

**** System hackery
Unfortunately, I seem to have run into a [[https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44994][bug]] present in my packaged version, so
we'll just install the latest from source.

For full use of the ~auth~ options, I need =GNU SASL=, which isn't packaged for me.
I don't think I want it, but in case I do, I'll need to do this.
#+name: Install gsasl from source
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "msmtp") "no" "setup.sh")
export GSASL_VERSION=1.8.1
cd ~/.local/lib/
curl "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsasl/libgsasl-$GSASL_VERSION.tar.gz" | tar xz
curl "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsasl/gsasl-$GSASL_VERSION.tar.gz" | tar xz
cd "./libgsasl-$GSASL_VERSION"
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
cd "./gsasl-$VERSION"
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
#+end_src

Now actually compile ~msmtp~.
#+name: Install msmtp from source
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "msmtp") "no" "setup.sh")
cd ~/.local/lib/
git clone https://github.com/marlam/msmtp-mirror.git ./msmtp
cd ./msmtp

aclocal
autoheader
automake --force-missing --add-missing
autoconf
# if using GSASL
# PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --with-libgsasl
./configure
make
sudo make install
#+end_src

If using =GSASL= (from earlier) we need to make ensure that the dynamic library in
in the library path. We can do by adding an executable with the same name
earlier on in my ~$PATH~.
#+begin_src sh :tangle no :shebang "#!/bin/sh"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib exec /usr/local/bin/msmtp "$@"
#+end_src

*** Mu4e
Webmail clients are nice and all, but I still don't believe that SPAs in my
browser can replaced desktop apps ... sorry Gmail. I'm also liking google less
and less.

Mailspring is a decent desktop client, quite lightweight for electron
(apparently the backend is in =C=, which probably helps), however I miss Emacs
stuff.

While =Notmuch= seems very promising, and I've heard good things about it, it
doesn't seem to make any changes to the emails themselves. All data is stored in
Notmuch's database. While this is a very interesting model, occasionally I need
to pull up an email on say my phone, and so not I want the tagging/folders etc.
to be applied to the mail itself --- not stored in a database.

On the other hand =Mu4e= is also talked about a lot in positive terms, and seems
to possess a similarly strong feature set --- and modifies the mail itself (I.e.
information is accessible without the database). =Mu4e= also seems to have a large
user base, which tends to correlate with better support and attention.

As I installed mu4e from source, I need to add the =/usr/local/= loadpath so Mu4e has a chance of loading
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (file-directory-p "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e") "yes" "no")
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e")
#+end_src

**** Viewing Mail
There seem to be some advantages with using Gnus' article view (such as inline
images), and judging from [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/pull/1442#issuecomment-591695814][djcb/mu!1442 (comment)]] this seems to be the 'way of
the future' for mu4e.

There are some all-the-icons font related issues, so we need to redefine the
fancy chars, and make sure they get the correct width.

To account for the increase width of each flag character, and make perform a
few more visual tweaks, we'll tweak the headers a bit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! mu4e
  (setq mu4e-headers-fields
        '((:flags . 6)
          (:account-stripe . 2)
          (:from-or-to . 25)
          (:folder . 10)
          (:recipnum . 2)
          (:subject . 80)
          (:human-date . 8))
        +mu4e-min-header-frame-width 142
        mu4e-headers-date-format "%d/%m/%y"
        mu4e-headers-time-format "⧖ %H:%M"
        mu4e-headers-results-limit 1000
        mu4e-index-cleanup t)

  (add-to-list 'mu4e-bookmarks
               '(:name "Yesterday's messages" :query "date:2d..1d" :key ?y) t)

  (defvar +mu4e-header--folder-colors nil)
  (appendq! mu4e-header-info-custom
            '((:folder .
               (:name "Folder" :shortname "Folder" :help "Lowest level folder" :function
                (lambda (msg)
                  (+mu4e-colorize-str
                   (replace-regexp-in-string "\\`.*/" "" (mu4e-message-field msg :maildir))
                   '+mu4e-header--folder-colors)))))))
#+end_src

We'll also use a nicer alert icon
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq mu4e-alert-icon "/usr/share/icons/Papirus/64x64/apps/evolution.svg")
#+end_src
**** Sending Mail
Let's send emails too.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! mu4e
  (setq sendmail-program "/usr/bin/msmtp"
        send-mail-function #'smtpmail-send-it
        message-sendmail-f-is-evil t
        message-sendmail-extra-arguments '("--read-envelope-from"); , "--read-recipients")
        message-send-mail-function #'message-send-mail-with-sendmail))
#+end_src

It's also nice to avoid accidentally sending emails with the wrong account.
If we can send from the address in the ~To~ field, let's do that. Opening an ~ivy~
prompt otherwise also seems sensible.

We can register Emacs as a potential email client with the following desktop
file, thanks to Etienne Deparis's [[https://etienne.depar.is/emacs.d/mu4e.html][Mu4e customization]].
#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/emacsmail.desktop :mkdirp yes
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Compose message in Emacs
GenericName=Compose a new message with Mu4e in Emacs
Comment=Open mu4e compose window
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/mailto;
Exec=emacsclient -create-frame --alternate-editor="" --no-wait --eval '(progn (x-focus-frame nil) (mu4e-compose-from-mailto "%u"))'
Icon=emacs
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Categories=Network;Email;
StartupWMClass=Emacs
#+end_src

To register this, just call
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/mailto") "emacsmail.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
#+end_src

We also want to define ~mu4e-compose-from-mailto~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun mu4e-compose-from-mailto (mailto-string)
  (require 'mu4e)
  (unless mu4e~server-props (mu4e t) (sleep-for 0.1))
  (let* ((mailto (rfc2368-parse-mailto-url mailto-string))
         (to (cdr (assoc "To" mailto)))
         (subject (or (cdr (assoc "Subject" mailto)) ""))
         (body (cdr (assoc "Body" mailto)))
         (org-msg-greeting-fmt (if (assoc "Body" mailto)
                                   (replace-regexp-in-string "%" "%%"
                                                             (cdr (assoc "Body" mailto)))
                                 org-msg-greeting-fmt))
         (headers (-filter (lambda (spec) (not (-contains-p '("To" "Subject" "Body") (car spec)))) mailto)))
    (mu4e~compose-mail to subject headers)))
#+end_src
This may not quite function as intended for now due to [[github:jeremy-compostella/org-msg/issues/52][jeremy-compostella/org-msg#52]].

It would also be nice to change the name pre-filled in =From:= when drafting.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mu4e-from-name "Timothy"
  "Name used in \"From:\" template.")
(defadvice! mu4e~draft-from-construct-renamed (orig-fn)
  "Wrap `mu4e~draft-from-construct-renamed' to change the name."
  :around #'mu4e~draft-from-construct
  (let ((user-full-name mu4e-from-name))
    (funcall orig-fn)))
#+end_src
*** Org Msg
Doom does a fantastic stuff with the defaults with this, so we only make a few
minor tweaks.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +org-msg-accent-color "#1a5fb4"
      org-msg-greeting-fmt "\nHi %s,\n\n"
      org-msg-signature "\n\n#+begin_signature\nAll the best,\\\\\n*Timothy*\n#+end_signature")
(map! :map org-msg-edit-mode-map
      :after org-msg
      :n "G" #'org-msg-goto-body)
#+end_src
* Language configuration
** General
*** File Templates
For some file types, we overwrite defaults in the [[file:./snippets][snippets]] directory, others
need to have a template assigned.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-file-template! "\\.tex$" :trigger "__" :mode 'latex-mode)
(set-file-template! "\\.org$" :trigger "__" :mode 'org-mode)
(set-file-template! "/LICEN[CS]E$" :trigger '+file-templates/insert-license)
#+end_src
** Plaintext
It's nice to see ANSI colour codes displayed
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! text-mode
  (add-hook! 'text-mode-hook
             ;; Apply ANSI color codes
             (with-silent-modifications
               (ansi-color-apply-on-region (point-min) (point-max)))))
#+end_src
** Org Mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no :noweb-ref org-conf
:END:
:intro:
I really like org mode, I've given some thought to why, and below is the result.

Beyond the elegance in the markup language, tremendously rich integrations with
Emacs allow for some fantastic [[https://orgmode.org/features.html][features]], such as what seems to be the best
support for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] of any currently available technology.

An =.org= file can contain blocks of code (with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb][noweb]] templating support), which
can be [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][tangled]] to dedicated source code files, and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][woven]] into a document
(report, documentation, presentation, etc.) through various (/extensible/) methods.
These source blocks may even create images or other content to be included in
the document, or generate source code.

*** System config
**** Mime types
Org mode isn't recognised as it's own mime type by default, but that can easily
be changed with the following file. For system-wide changes try
~/usr/share/mime/packages/org.xml~.
#+begin_src xml :tangle ~/.local/share/mime/packages/org.xml :mkdirp yes :comments none
<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>

    <alias type="text/org"/>

What's nice is that Papirus [[https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/commit/a10fb7f2423d5e30b9c4477416ccdc93c4f3849d][now]] has an icon for =text/org=.
One simply needs to refresh their mime database
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "") "setup.sh" "no")
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
#+end_src
Then set Emacs as the default editor
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "emacs-client.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")

*** Behaviour
[[xkcd:1319]]
**** Tweaking defaults
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/.org"                      ; let's put files here
      org-use-property-inheritance t              ; it's convenient to have properties inherited
      org-log-done 'time                          ; having the time a item is done sounds convininet
      org-list-allow-alphabetical t               ; have a. A. a) A) list bullets
      org-export-in-background t                  ; run export processes in external emacs process
      org-catch-invisible-edits 'smart            ; try not to accidently do weird stuff in invisible regions
      org-export-with-sub-superscripts '{}        ; don't treat lone _ / ^ as sub/superscripts, require _{} / ^{}
      org-re-reveal-root "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js")
#+end_src
I also like the ~:comments~ header-argument, so let's make that a default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-default-header-args
      '((:session . "none")
        (:results . "replace")
        (:exports . "code")
        (:cache . "no")
        (:noweb . "no")
        (:hlines . "no")
        (:tangle . "no")
        (:comments . "link")))
#+end_src

By default, ~visual-line-mode~ is turned =on=, and ~auto-fill-mode~ =off= by a hook.
However this messes with tables in Org-mode, and other plaintext files (e.g.
markdown, \LaTeX) so I'll turn it off for this, and manually enable it for more
specific modes as desired.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'text-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'auto-fill-mode)
#+end_src

There also seem to be a few keybindings which use =hjkl=, but miss arrow key equivalents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-org-mode-map
      :after evil-org
      :n "g <up>" #'org-backward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <down>" #'org-forward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <left>" #'org-up-element
      :n "g <right>" #'org-down-element)
#+end_src
**** Extra functionality
***** Org buffer creation
Let's also make creating an org buffer just that little bit easier.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes :noweb-ref none
(evil-define-command evil-buffer-org-new (count file)
  "Creates a new ORG buffer replacing the current window, optionally
   editing a certain FILE"
  :repeat nil
  (interactive "P<f>")
  (if file
      (evil-edit file)
    (let ((buffer (generate-new-buffer "*new org*")))
      (set-window-buffer nil buffer)
      (with-current-buffer buffer
        (org-mode)))))
(map! :leader
      (:prefix "b"
       :desc "New empty ORG buffer" "o" #'evil-buffer-org-new))
#+end_src
***** List bullet sequence
I think it makes sense to have list bullets change with depth
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-list-demote-modify-bullet '(("+" . "-") ("-" . "+") ("*" . "+") ("1." . "a.")))
#+end_src
***** Citation
Occasionally I want to cite something.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-ref
  :after org
  :config
  (setq org-ref-completion-library 'org-ref-ivy-cite))
#+end_src
***** cdlatex
It's also nice to be able to use ~cdlatex~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex)
#+end_src

It's handy to be able to quickly insert environments with =C-c }=. I almost always
want to edit them afterwards though, so let's make that happen by default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-edit-latex-emv-after-insert ()
  :after #'org-cdlatex-environment-indent

#+end_src

At some point in the future it could be good to investigate [[https://scripter.co/splitting-an-org-block-into-two/][splitting org blocks]].
Likewise [[https://archive.casouri.cat/note/2020/insert-math-symbol-in-emacs/][this]] looks good for symbols.

**** Roam
***** Basic settings
I'll just set this to be within =Organisation= folder for now, in the future it
could be worth seeing if I could hook this up to a [[https://nextcloud.com/][Nextcloud]] instance.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle yes
(setq org-roam-directory "~/Desktop/TEC/Organisation/Roam/")

That said, if the directory doesn't exist we likely don't want to be using roam.
Since we don't want to trigger errors (which will happen as soon as roam tries
to initialise), let's not load roam.

***** Registering roam protocol
The recommended method of registering a protocol is by registering a desktop
application, which seems reasonable.

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Org-Protocol
Exec=emacsclient %u
Icon=emacs-icon
Type=Application
Terminal=false
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol
#+end_src
To associate ~org-protocol://~ links with the desktop file,
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/org-protocol") "org-protocol.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")

#+end_src
***** Graph Behaviour
By default, clicking on an ~org-protocol://~ link messes with the =svg= view. To fix
this we can use an ~iframe~, however that requires shifting to an =html= file.
Hence, we need to do a bit of overriding.

**** Nicer generated heading IDs

By default, ~url-hexify-string~ seemed to cause me some issues. Replacing that in
~a53899~ resolved this for me. To go one step further, I create a function for
producing nice short links, like an inferior version of ~reftex-label~.

  "Using `org-reference-contraction-max-length' as the total character 'budget' for the WORDS

To arrive at a budget that accounts for words undershooting their requisite average length,
the number of charachters in the budget freed by short words is distributed among the words

**** Snippet Helpers

I often want to set =src-block= headers, and it's a pain to
+ type them out
+ remember what the accepted values are
+ oh, and specifying the same language again and again

We can solve this in three steps
+ having one-letter snippets, conditioned on ~(point)~ being within a src header
+ creating a nice prompt showing accepted values and the current default
+ pre-filling the =src-block= language with the last language used

For header args, the keys I'll use are
+ =r= for =:results=
+ =e= for =:exports=
+ =v= for =:eval=
+ =s= for =:session=
+ =d= for =:dir=

**** Translate capital keywords (old) to lower case (new)
Everyone used to use ~#+CAPITAL~ keywords. Then people realised that ~#+lowercase~
is actually both marginally easier and visually nicer, so now the capital
version is just used in the manual.
#+begin_quote
Org is standardized on lower case. Uppercase is used in the manual as a poor
man's bold, and supported for historical reasons. --- [[https://orgmode.org/list/87tuuw3n15.fsf@nicolasgoaziou.fr][Nicolas Goaziou on the Org ML]]

To avoid sometimes having to choose between the hassle out of updating old
documents and using mixed syntax, I'll whip up a basic transcode-y function.
It likely misses some edge cases, but should mostly work.

*** Visuals

Here I try to do two things: improve the styling of the various documents, via
font changes etc, and also propagate colours from the current theme.

[[xkcd:1882]]

**** Font Display
Mixed pitch is great. As is ~+org-pretty-mode~, let's use them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! 'org-mode-hook #'+org-pretty-mode #'mixed-pitch-mode)
#+end_src
Earlier I loaded the ~org-pretty-table~ package, let's enable it everywhere!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq global-org-pretty-table-mode t)
#+end_src

Let's make headings a bit bigger
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.25)
  '(outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.15)
  '(outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.12)
  '(outline-4 :weight semi-bold :height 1.09)
  '(outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06)
  '(outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03)
  '(outline-8 :weight semi-bold)
  '(outline-9 :weight semi-bold))
#+end_src

And the same with the title.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-document-title :height 1.2))
#+end_src

It seems reasonable to have deadlines in the error face when they're passed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-deadline-faces
      '((1.001 . error)
        (1.0 . org-warning)
        (0.5 . org-upcoming-deadline)
        (0.0 . org-upcoming-distant-deadline)))
#+end_src

We can then have quote blocks stand out a bit more by making them /italic/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+end_src

While ~org-hide-emphasis-markers~ is very nice, it can sometimes make edits which
occur at the border a bit more fiddley. We can improve this situation without
sacrificing visual amenities with the =org-appear= package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-appear
  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-appear-autoemphasis t
        org-appear-autosubmarkers t
        org-appear-autolinks nil)
  ;; for proper first-time setup, `org-appear--set-fragments'
  ;; needs to be run after other hooks have acted.
  (run-at-time nil nil #'org-appear--set-fragments))
#+end_src
**** Symbols
It's also nice to change the character used for collapsed items (by default ~…~),
I think ~▾~ is better for indicating 'collapsed section'.
and add an extra ~org-bullet~ to the default list of four.
I've also added some fun alternatives, just commented out.

**** LaTeX Fragments
First off, we want those fragments to look good.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(native script entities))
#+end_src

What's better than syntax-highlighted LaTeX is /rendered/ LaTeX though, and we can
have this be performed automatically with =org-fragtog=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-fragtog
  :hook (org-mode . org-fragtog-mode))
#+end_src

It's nice to customise the look of LaTeX fragments so they fit better in the
text --- like this \(\sqrt{\beta^2+3}-\sum_{\phi=1}^\infty \frac{x^\phi-1}{\Gamma(a)}\). Let's start by adding a sans font.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-header "\\documentclass{article}
\\usepackage[usenames]{color}

\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\\usepackage{booktabs}

\\pagestyle{empty}             % do not remove
% The settings below are copied from fullpage.sty
\\setlength{\\textwidth}{\\paperwidth}
\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{-3cm}

#+end_src

We can either render from a ~dvi~ or ~pdf~ file, so let's benchmark ~latex~ and
~pdflatex~.
| ~latex~ time | ~pdflatex~ time |
|------------+---------------|
| 135 \pm 2 ms | 215 \pm 3 ms    |

On the rendering side, there are two ~.dvi~-to-image converters which I am
interested in: ~dvipng~ and ~dvisvgm~. Then with the a ~.pdf~ we have ~pdf2svg~.
For inline preview we care about speed, while for exporting we care about file
size and prefer a vector graphic.

Using the above latex expression and benchmarking lead to the following results:
| ~dvipng~ time | ~dvisvgm~ time | ~pdf2svg~ time |
|-------------+--------------+--------------|
| 89 \pm 2 ms   | 178 \pm 2 ms   | 12 \pm 2 ms    |

Now let's combine this to see what's best
| Tool chain         | Total time | Resultant file size |
|--------------------+------------+---------------------|
| ~latex~ + ~dvipng~     | 226 \pm 2 ms | 7 KiB               |
| ~latex~ + ~dvisvgm~    | 392 \pm 4 ms | 8 KiB               |
| ~pdflatex~ + ~pdf2svg~ | 230 \pm 2 ms | 16 KiB              |

So, let's use ~dvipng~ for previewing LaTeX fragments in-Emacs, but ~dvisvgm~ for [[LaTeX Rendering]].
/Unfortunately: it seems that svg sizing is annoying ATM, so let's actually not do this right now./

As well as having a sans font, there are a few other tweaks which can make them
look better. Namely making sure that the colours switch when the theme does.

**** Collapsable src and example blocks
By wrapping the ~<pre>~ element in a ~<details>~ block, we can obtain collapsable
blocks with no CSS, though we will toss a little in anyway to have this looking
somewhat spiffy.

Since this collapsability seems useful to have on by default for certain chunks
of code, it would be nice if you could set it with =#+attr_html: :collapsed t=.

It would be nice to also have a corresponding global / session-local way of
setting this, but I haven't quite been able to get that working (yet).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-html-export-collapsed nil)

(add-to-list 'org-default-properties "EXPORT_COLLAPSED")
#+end_src

We can take our src block modification a step further, and add a gutter on the
side of the src block containing both an anchor referencing the current block,
and a button to copy the content of the block.

**** Include extra font-locking in htmlize

Org uses [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize.el]] to export buffers with syntax highlighting.

The works fantastically, for the most part. Minor modes that provide
font-locking are /not/ loaded, and so do not impact the result.

By enabling these modes in ~htmlize-before-hook~ we can correct this behaviour.

**** Handle table overflow
In order to accommodate wide tables ---particularly on mobile devices--- we want
to set a maximum width and scroll overflow. Unfortunately, this cannot be applied
directly to the ~table~ element, so we have to wrap it in a ~div~.

While we're at it, we can a link gutter, as we did with src blocks, and show the
~#+name~, if one is given.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html-table-wrapped (orig-fn table contents info)

           (ref (org-export-get-reference table info)))

#+end_src
**** TOC as a collapsable tree
The TOC is much nicer to navigate as a collapsable tree. Unfortunately we cannot
achieve this with CSS alone. Thankfully we can avoid JS though, by adapting the
TOC generation code to use a ~label~ for each item, and a hidden ~checkbox~ to keep
track of state.

To add this, we need to change one line in [[file:~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/org-mode/lisp/ox-html.el::(format "<a href=\"#%s\">%s</a>"][org-html--format-toc-headline]].

Since we can actually accomplish the desired effect by adding advice /around/ the
function, without overriding it --- let's do that to reduce the bug surface of
this config a tad.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable (orig-fn headline info)
  "Add a label and checkbox to `org-html--format-toc-headline's usual output,
to allow the TOC to be a collapseable tree."
  :around #'org-html--format-toc-headline
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn headline info)
    (let ((id (or (org-element-property :CUSTOM_ID headline)
                  (org-export-get-reference headline info))))
      (format "<input type='checkbox' id='toc--%s'/><label for='toc--%s'>%s</label>"
              id id (funcall orig-fn headline info)))))
#+end_src

Now, leaves (headings with no children) shouldn't have the ~label~ item. The
obvious way to achieve this is by including some /if no children.../ logic in
~org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable~. Unfortunately, I can't my elisp isn't
up to par to extract the number of child headings from the mountain of info that
org provides.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (replace-regexp-in-string "<input [^>]+><label [^>]+>\\(.+?\\)</label></li>" "\\1</li>"

#+end_src
**** Make verbatim different to code
Since we have =verbatim= and ~code~, let's make use of the difference.

We can use ~code~ exclusively for code snippets and commands like: "calling ~(message
"Hello")~ in batch-mode Emacs prints to stdout like ~echo~".
Then we can use =verbatim= for miscellaneous 'other monospace' like keyboard
shortcuts: "either =C-c C-c= or =C-g= is likely the most useful keybinding in Emacs",
or file names: "I keep my configuration in =~/.config/doom/=", among other things.

Then, styling these two cases differently can help improve clarity in a document.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-text-markup-alist
      '((bold . "<b>%s</b>")
        (code . "<code>%s</code>")

***** MathJax
If MathJax is used, we want to use version 3 instead of the default version 2.
Looking at a [[https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php][comparison]] we seem to find that it is ~5 times as fast, uses a
single file instead of multiple, but seems to be a bit bigger unfortunately.
Thankfully this can be mitigated my adding the ~async~ attribute to defer loading.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

      '((path "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-svg.js" )

*** LaTeX Export
**** Compiling
By default Org uses ~pdflatex~ \times 3 + ~bibtex~. This simply won't do in our
modern world. ~latexmk~ + ~biber~ (which is used automatically with ~latexmk~) is a
simply superior combination.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; org-latex-compilers = ("pdflatex" "xelatex" "lualatex"), which are the possible values for %latex
(setq org-latex-pdf-process '("latexmk -%latex -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode -f -pdf -output-directory=%o %f"))
#+end_src

While ~org-latex-pdf-process~ does support a function, and we could use that
instead, this would no longer use the log buffer --- it's a bit blind, you give
it the file name and expect it to do its thing.

The default values of ~org-latex-compilers~ is given in commented form to see how
~org-latex-pdf-process~ works with them.

While the ~-%latex~ above is slightly hacky (~-pdflatex~ expects to be given a
value) it allows us to leave ~org-latex-compilers~ unmodified.
This is nice in case I open an org file that uses =#+LATEX_COMPILER= for example,
it should still work.

**** A cleverer preamble
***** Use case
We always want some particular elements in the preamble, let's call this
the "universal preamble"
#+name: org-latex-universal-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage[main,include]{embedall}
\\IfFileExists{./\\jobname.org}{\\embedfile[desc=The original file]{\\jobname.org}}{}
#+end_src

We could have every package we could possibly need in every one of
~org-latex-classes~, but that's /horribly/ inefficient and I don't want to think
about maintaining that.

Instead, we can have a "universal preamble" which contains a snippet which we
want to /always/ appear, and then conditional preamble snippets, which are only
included when a certain regex is successfully found in the Org buffer.

***** Conditional Content

Let's consider some other content we only want in certain sutuations.

~org-latex-default-packages-alist~.

There are also some obsolete entries in the default value, specifically
+ =grffile='s capabilities are built into the current version of =graphicx=
+ =textcomp='s functionality has been included in LaTeX's core for a while now

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** Pretty code blocks

We could just use minted for syntax highlighting --- however, we can do better!
The =engrave-faces= package lets us use Emacs' font-lock for syntax highlighting,
exporting that as LaTeX commands.

(setq org-latex-listings 'engraved) ; NOTE non-standard value
#+end_src

Thanks to ~org-latex-conditional-preambles~ and some copy-paste with the =minted=
entry in ~org-latex-scr-block~ we can easily add this as a recognised
~org-latex-listings~ value.

#+end_src

Whenever this is used, in order for it to actually work (and look a little
better) we add bit to the preamble:

#+name: org-latex-engraved-code-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage{fvextra}
\\fvset{
  commandchars=\\\\\\{\\},
  highlightcolor=white!95!black!80!blue,
  breaklines=true,
  breaksymbol=\\color{white!60!black}\\tiny\\ensuremath{\\hookrightarrow}}
\\renewcommand\\theFancyVerbLine{\\footnotesize\\color{black!40!white}\\arabic{FancyVerbLine}}

% TODO have code boxes keep line vertical alignment
\\usepackage[breakable,xparse]{tcolorbox}
\\DeclareTColorBox[]{Code}{o}%
{colback=white!97!black, colframe=white!94!black,
  fontupper=\\color{EFD}\\footnotesize,
  IfNoValueTF={#1}%
  {boxsep=2pt, arc=2.5pt, outer arc=2.5pt,
    boxrule=0.5pt, left=2pt}%
  {boxsep=2.5pt, arc=0pt, outer arc=0pt,
    boxrule=0pt, leftrule=1.5pt, left=0.5pt},
  right=2pt, top=1pt, bottom=0.5pt,
  breakable}
#+end_src

At some point it would be nice to make the box colours easily customisable. At
the moment it's fairly easy to change the syntax highlighting colours with
src_emacs-lisp[:eval no :exports code]{(setq engrave-faces-preset-styles
(engrave-faces-generate-preset))}, but perhaps a toggle which specifies whether
to use the default values, the current theme, or any named theme could be a good
idea. It should also possible to set the box background dynamically to match.
The named theme could work by looking for a style definition with a certain name
in a cache dir, and then switching to that theme and producing (and saving) the
style definition if it doesn't exist.

Now let's have the example block be styled similarly.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-latex-example-block-engraved (orig-fn example-block contents info)
  "Like `org-latex-example-block', but supporting an engraved backend"
  :around #'org-latex-example-block
  (let ((output-block (funcall orig-fn example-block contents info)))
    (if (eq 'engraved (plist-get info :latex-listings))
        (format "\\begin{Code}[alt]\n%s\n\\end{Code}" output-block)
      output-block)))
#+end_src

In addition to the vastly superior visual output, this should also be much
faster to for code-heavy documents (like this config).

Performing a little benchmark with this document, I find that this is indeed the
case.

Treating the verbatim (no syntax highlighting) result as a baseline; this
rudimentary test suggest that =engrave-faces= is around eight times faster than
=pygments=, and takes three times as long as no syntax highlighting (verbatim).

**** Remove non-ascii chars

When using ~pdflatex~, almost non-ascii characters are generally problematic, and
don't appear in the pdf. It's preferable to see that there was /some/ character
which wasn't displayed as opposed to nothing.

So, as a basic first-pass we replace every non-ascii char with =¿=. In future I
could add sensible replacements (e.g. turn =§= into =\S=, and =…= with =\ldots=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-latex-replace-non-ascii-chars (text backend info)
  "Replace non-ascii chars with \\char\"XYZ forms."
  (when (and (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
             (string= (plist-get info :latex-compiler) "pdflatex"))
    (replace-regexp-in-string "[^[:ascii:]]" "¿" text)))

#+end_src

**** Support images from URLs
You can link to remote images easily, and they work nicely with HTML-based
exports. However, LaTeX can only include local files, and so the current
behaviour of =org-latex-link= is just to insert a URL to the image.

We can do better than that by downloading the image to a predictable location,
and using that. By making the filename predictable as opposed to just another
tempfile, this can provide a caching mechanism.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** Make verbatim different to code
Since have just gone to so much effort above let's make the most of it by making
=verbatim= use ~verb~ instead of ~protectedtexttt~ (default).

This gives the same advantages as mentioned in the [[*Make verbatim different to code][HTML export section]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-text-markup-alist
      '((bold . "\\textbf{%s}")
        (code . protectedtexttt)
        (italic . "\\emph{%s}")
        (strike-through . "\\sout{%s}")
        (underline . "\\uline{%s}")
        (verbatim . verb)))
#+end_src
*** Beamer Export
It's nice to use a different theme
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-beamer-theme "[progressbar=foot]metropolis")
#+end_src
Then customise it a bit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
And I think that it's natural to divide a presentation into sections, e.g.
Introduction, Overview... so let's set bump up the headline level that becomes a
frame from ~1~ to ~2~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-beamer-frame-level 2)
#+end_src
*** Markdown Export
When I want to paste exported markdown somewhere (for example when using [[Emacs Everywhere][Emacs
Everywhere]]), it can be preferable to have unicode characters for =---= etc. instead
of =&#x2014;=.

To accomplish this, we just need to locally rebind the alist which provides
these substitution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-md-plain-text-unicode-a (orig-fn text info)
  "Locally rebind `org-html-special-string-regexps'"
  :around #'org-md-plain-text
  (let ((org-html-special-string-regexps
         '(("\\\\-" . "-")
           ("---\\([^-]\\)" . "—\\1")
           ("--\\([^-]\\)" . "–\\1")
           ("\\.\\.\\." . "…"))))
    (funcall orig-fn text (plist-put info :with-smart-quotes nil))))
#+end_src

In the future, I may want to check =info= to only have this active when =ox-gfm= is
being used.

Another worthwhile consideration is LaTeX formatting. It seems most Markdown
parsers are fixated on TeX-style syntax (=$= and =$$=). As unfortunate as this is,
it's probably best to accommodate them, for the sake of decent rendering.

=ox-md= doesn't provide any transcoders for this, so we'll have to whip up our own
and push them onto the =md= transcoders alist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-md
  (defun org-md-latex-fragment (latex-fragment _contents info)

*** Babel
Doom lazy-loads babel languages, with is lovely.
It also pulls in [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]], which is nice, but it would be even better if it was
used by default.

There are two caveats to =ob-async=:
1. It does not support =:session=
   + So, we don't want =:async= used when =:session= is set
2. It adds a fixed delay to execution
   + This is undesirable in a number of cases, for example it's generally
     unwanted with =emacs-lisp= code
   + As such, I also introduce a async language blacklist to control when it's
     automatically enabled

Due to the nuance in the desired behaviour, instead of just adding =:async= to
~org-babel-default-header-args~, I advice ~org-babel-get-src-block-info~ to add
=:async= intelligently. As an escape hatch, it also recognises =:sync= as an
indication that =:async= should not be added.

** Markdown
Let's use mixed pitch, because it's great
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! (gfm-mode markdown-mode) #'mixed-pitch-mode)
#+end_src

Most of the time when I write markdown, it's going into some app/website which
will do it's own line wrapping, hence we /only/ want to use visual line wrapping. No hard stuff.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! (gfm-mode markdown-mode) #'visual-line-mode #'turn-off-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Since markdown is often seen as rendered HTML, let's try to somewhat mirror the
style or markdown renderers.

Most markdown renders seem to make the first three headings levels larger than
normal text, the first two much so. Then the fourth level tends to be the same
as body text, while the fifth and sixth are (increasingly) smaller, with the
sixth greyed out. Since the sixth level is so small, I'll turn up the boldness a notch.

** Beancount
There are a number of rather compelling advantages to [[https://plaintextaccounting.org/][plain text accounting]],
with [[https://www.ledger-cli.org/][ledger]] being the most obvious example. However, [[https://github.com/beancount/beancount][beancount]], a more recent
implementation of the idea is ledger-compatable (meaning I can switch easily if
I change my mind) and has a gorgeous front-end --- [[https://beancount.github.io/fava/][fava]].

Of course, there's an Emacs mode for this.
