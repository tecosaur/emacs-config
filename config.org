* Introduction
Customising an editor can be very rewarding ... until you have to leave it.
For years I have been looking for ways to avoid this pain.
Then I discovered [[https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere][vim-anywhere]], and found that it had an Emacs companion,
[[https://github.com/zachcurry/emacs-anywhere][emacs-anywhere]]. To me, this looked most attractive.

Separately, online I have seen the following statement enough times I think it's a catchphrase
#+begin_quote
Redditor 1: I just discovered this thing, isn't it cool. \\
Redditor 2: Oh, there's an Emacs mode for that.
#+end_quote

This was enough for me to install Emacs, but I soon learned there are [[https://github.com/remacs/remacs#why-emacs][far more
compelling reasons]] to keep using it.

I tried out the =spacemacs= distribution a bit, but it wasn't quite to my liking.
Then I heard about =doom emacs= and thought I may as well give that a try.
TLDR; it's great.

Now I've discovered the wonders of literate programming, and am becoming more
settled by the day. This is both my config, and a cautionary tale (just replace
"Linux" with "Emacs" in the comic below).

[[xkcd:456]]

** Why Emacs?

Emacs is [[https://www.eigenbahn.com/2020/01/12/emacs-is-no-editor][not a text editor]], this is a common misnomer. It is far more apt to
describe Emacs as /a Lisp machine providing a generic user-centric text
manipulation environment/. That's quite a mouthful.
In simpler terms one can think of Emacs as a platform for text-related
applications. It's a vague and generic definition because Emacs itself is
generic.

Good with text. How far does that go? A lot further than one initially thinks:
+ [[https://orgmode.org/][Task planning]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][File management]]
+ [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][Terminal emulation]]
+ [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][Email client]]
+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][Remote server tool]]
+ [[https://magit.vc/][Git frontend]]
+ Web [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][client]]/[[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][server]]
+ and more...

Ideally, one may use Emacs as /the/ interface to perform =input → transform →
output= cycles, i.e. form a bridge between the human mind and information
manipulation.

*** The enveloping editor
Emacs allows one to do more in one place than any other application. Why is this
good?
+ Enables one to complete tasks with a consistent, standard set of keybindings,
  GUI and editing methods --- learn once, use everywhere
+ Reduced context-switching
+ Compressing the stages of a project --- a more centralised workflow can progress
  with greater ease
+ Integration between tasks previously relegated to different applications, but
  with a common subject --- e.g. linking to an email in a to-do list

Emacs can be thought of as a platform within which various elements of your
workflow may settle, with the potential for rich integrations between them --- a
/life/ IDE if you will.

Today, many aspects of daily computer usage are split between different
applications which act like islands, but this often doesn't mirror how we
/actually use/ our computers. Emacs, if one goes down the rabbit hole, can give
users the power to bridge this gap.

*** Some notably unique features
+ Recursive editing
+ Completely introspectable, with pervasive docstrings
+ Mutable environment, which can be incrementally modified
+ Functionality without applications
+ Client-server separation allows for a daemon, giving near-instant perceived
  startup time.

*** Issues
+ Emacs has irritating quirks
+ Some aspects are showing their age (naming conventions, APIs)
+ Emacs is ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Threads.html][mostly]]) single-threaded, meaning that when something holds that
  thread up the whole application freezes
+ A few other nuisances

*** Teach a man to fish...
#+begin_quote
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed
him for a lifetime. --- Anne Isabella
#+end_quote

Most popular editors have a simple and pretty [[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings][settings interface]], filled with
check-boxes, selects, and the occasional text-box. This makes it easy for the
user to pick between common desirable behaviours. To me this is now like /giving
a man a fish/.

What if you want one of those 'check-box' settings to be only on in certain
conditions? Some editors have workspace settings, but that requires you to
manually set the value for /every single instance/. Urgh, [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/93153][what]] [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/93628][a]] [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/5595][pain]].

What if you could set the value of that 'check-box' setting to be the result of
an arbitrary expression evaluated for each file? This is where an editor like
Emacs comes in.
Configuration for Emacs isn't a list of settings in JSON etc. it's *an executable
program which modifies the behaviour of the editor to suit your liking*.
This is 'teaching a man to fish'.

Emacs is built in the same language you configure it in (Emacs [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][Lisp]], or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/][elisp]]).
It comes with a broad array of useful functions for text-editing, and Doom adds
a few handy little convenience functions.

Want to add a keybinding to delete the previous line? It's as easy as
#+name: Keybinding to delete the previous line
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(map! "C-d"
      (cmd! (previous-line)
            (kill-line)
            (forward-line)))
#+end_src

How about another example, say you want to be presented with a list of currently
open /buffers/ (think files, almost) when you split the window. It's as simple as
#+name: Prompt for buffer after split
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after 'window-split (switch-to-buffer))
#+end_src

Want to test it out? You don't need to save and restart, you can just /evaluate
the expression/ within your current Emacs instance and try it immediately! This
editor is, after all, a Lisp interpreter.

Want to tweak the behaviour? Just re-evaluate your new version --- it's a
super-tight iteration loop.

** Editor comparison

[[xkcd:378]]

Over the years I have tried out (spent at least a year using as my primary
editor) the following applications
- Python IDLE
- Komodo Edit
- Brackets
- VSCode
- and now, Emacs

I have attempted to quantify aspects of my impressions of them below.

#+plot: transpose:yes type:radar min:0 max:4 ticks:4 file:"misc/editor-comparison.svg"

** Notes for the unwary adventurer
If you like the look of this, that's marvellous, and I'm really happy that I've
made something which you may find interesting, however:
#+begin_warning
This config is /insidious/. Copying the whole thing blindly can easily lead to
undesired effects. I recommend copying chunks instead.
#+end_warning

If you are so bold as to wish to steal bits of my config (or if I upgrade and
wonder why things aren't working), here's a list of sections which rely on
external setup (i.e. outside of this config).

+ dictionary :: I've downloaded a custom [[http://app.aspell.com/create][SCOWL]] dictionary, which I use in [[*Ispell][ispell]].
  If this causes issues, just delete the src_elisp{(setq ispell-dictionary ...)}
  bit.

Oh, did I mention that I started this config when I didn't know any =elisp=, and
this whole thing is a hack job? If you can suggest any improvements, please do
so, no matter how much criticism you include I'll appreciate it :)

[[xkcd:1513]]

*** Extra Requirements
The lovely ~doom doctor~ is good at diagnosing most missing things, but here are a
few extras.
+ A [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][LaTeX Compiler]] is required for the mathematics rendering performed in [[#org][Org]],
  and by [[*CalcTeX][CalcTeX]].
+ I use the [[https://overpassfont.org/][Overpass]] font as a go-to sans serif.
  It's used as my ~doom-variable-pitch-font~ and in the graph generated
  by [[*Roam][Roam]].
  I have chosen it because it possesses a few characteristics I consider
  desirable, namely:
  - A clean, and legible style. Highway-style fonts tend to be designed to be
    clear at a glance, and work well with a thicker weight, and this is inspired
    by /Highway Gothic/.
  - It's slightly quirky. Look at the diagonal cut on stems for example.
    Helvetica is a masterful design, but I like a bit more pizzazz now and then.
+ A few LSP servers. Take a look at [[file:init.el][init.el]] to see which modules have the ~+lsp~ flag.

** Current Issues
*** Magit push in daemon
Quite often trying to push to a remote in the Emacs daemon produces as error like this:
#+begin_src fundamental
128 git … push -v origin refs/heads/master\:refs/heads/master
Pushing to git@github.com:tecosaur/emacs-config.git

fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
#+end_src
*** Unread emails doesn't work across Emacs instances
It would be nice if it did, so that I could have the Emacs-daemon hold the
active mu4e session, but still get that information. In this case I'd want to
change the action to open the Emacs daemon, but it should be possible.

This would probably involve hooking into the daemon's modeline update function
to write to a temporary file, and having a file watcher started in other Emacs
instances, in a similar manner to [[*Rebuild mail index while using mu4e][Rebuild mail index while using mu4e]].

* Rudimentary configuration
Make this file run (slightly) faster with lexical binding (see [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2016/12/22/][this blog post]]
for more info).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :comments no
;;; config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :exports none :comments no :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#+end_src
** Personal Information
It's useful to have some basic personal information
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "TEC"
      user-mail-address "tec@tecosaur.com")
#+end_src
Apparently this is used by ~GPG~, and all sorts of other things.

Speaking of ~GPG~, I want to use =~/.authinfo.gpg= instead of the default in
=~/.emacs.d=. Why? Because my home directory is already cluttered, so this won't
make a difference, and I don't want to accidentally purge this file (I have done
src_shell{rm -rf~/.emac.d~ before}. I also want to cache as much as possible, as
my home machine is pretty safe, and my laptop is shutdown a lot.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg")
      auth-source-cache-expiry nil) ; default is 7200 (2h)
#+end_src
** Better defaults
*** Simple settings
Browsing the web and seeing [[https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs/blob/master/dotemacs.org#use-better-defaults][angrybacon/dotemacs]] and comparing with the values
shown by =SPC h v= and selecting what I thought looks good, I've ended up adding
the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default
 delete-by-moving-to-trash t                      ; Delete files to trash
 window-combination-resize t                      ; take new window space from all other windows (not just current)
 x-stretch-cursor t)                              ; Stretch cursor to the glyph width

(setq undo-limit 80000000                         ; Raise undo-limit to 80Mb
      evil-want-fine-undo t                       ; By default while in insert all changes are one big blob. Be more granular
      auto-save-default t                         ; Nobody likes to loose work, I certainly don't
      truncate-string-ellipsis "…"                ; Unicode ellispis are nicer than "...", and also save /precious/ space
      password-cache-expiry nil                   ; I can trust my computers ... can't I?
      ;; scroll-preserve-screen-position 'always     ; Don't have `point' jump around
      scroll-margin 2)                            ; It's nice to maintain a little margin

(display-time-mode 1)                             ; Enable time in the mode-line

(unless (string-match-p "^Power N/A" (battery))   ; On laptops...
  (display-battery-mode 1))                       ; it's nice to know how much power you have

(global-subword-mode 1)                           ; Iterate through CamelCase words
#+end_src
*** Frame sizing
It's nice to control the size of new frames, when launching Emacs that can be
done with src_shell{emacs -geometry 160x48}. After the font size adjustment
during initialisation this works out to be ~102x31~.

Thanks to hotkeys, it's easy for me to expand a frame to half/full-screen, so it
makes sense to be conservative with the sizing of new frames.

Then, for creating new frames within the same Emacs instance, we'll just set the
default to be something roughly 80% of that size.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 24))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 80))
#+end_src
*** Auto-customisations
By default changes made via a customisation interface are added to =init.el=.
I prefer the idea of using a separate file for this. We just need to change a
setting, and load it if it exists.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default custom-file (expand-file-name ".custom.el" doom-private-dir))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))
#+end_src
*** Windows
I find it rather handy to be asked which buffer I want to see after splitting
the window. Let's make that happen.

First, we'll enter the new window
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq evil-vsplit-window-right t
      evil-split-window-below t)
#+end_src

Then, we'll pull up a buffer prompt.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! prompt-for-buffer (&rest _)
  :after '(evil-window-split evil-window-vsplit)
  (consult-buffer))
#+end_src

Window rotation is nice, and can be found under =SPC w r= and =SPC w R=.
/Layout/ rotation is also nice though. Let's stash this under =SPC w SPC=, inspired
by Tmux's use of =C-b SPC= to rotate windows.

We could also do with adding the missing arrow-key variants of the window
navigation/swapping commands.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-window-map
      "SPC" #'rotate-layout
      ;; Navigation
      "<left>"     #'evil-window-left
      "<down>"     #'evil-window-down
      "<up>"       #'evil-window-up
      "<right>"    #'evil-window-right
      ;; Swapping windows
      "C-<left>"       #'+evil/window-move-left
      "C-<down>"       #'+evil/window-move-down
      "C-<up>"         #'+evil/window-move-up
      "C-<right>"      #'+evil/window-move-right)
#+end_src
*** Buffer defaults
I'd much rather have my new buffers in ~org-mode~ than ~fundamental-mode~, hence
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default major-mode 'org-mode)
#+end_src
For some reason this + the mixed pitch hook causes issues with hydra and so I'll
just need to resort to =SPC b o= for now.
** Doom configuration
*** Modules
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
Doom has this lovely /modular configuration base/ that takes a lot of work out of
configuring Emacs. Each module (when enabled) can provide a list of packages to
install (on ~doom sync~) and configuration to be applied. The modules can also
have flags applied to tweak their behaviour.

#+name: init.el
#+attr_html: :collapsed t

**** Structure
As you may have noticed by this point, this is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] configuration. Doom
has good support for this which we access though the ~literate~ module.

While we're in the src_elisp{:config} section, we'll use Dooms nicer defaults,
along with the bindings and smartparens behaviour (the flags aren't documented,
but they exist).
#+name: doom-config

I reckon enabling half the modules Doom provides should do it.

*** Visual Settings
**** Font Face
'Fira Code' is nice, and 'Overpass' makes for a nice sans companion. We just need to
fiddle with the font sizes a tad so that they visually match. Just for fun I'm
trying out JetBrains Mono though. So far I have mixed feelings on it, some
aspects are nice, but on others I prefer Fira.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Screenshot of the fonts within Emacs.

In addition to these fonts, Merriweather is used with =nov.el=, and Alegreya as a
serifed proportional font used by =mixed-pitch-mode= for =writeroom-mode= with Org
files.

Because we care about how things look let's add a check to make sure we're told
if the system doesn't have any of those fonts.

#+name: detect-missing-fonts
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defvar required-fonts '("JetBrainsMono.*" "Overpass" "JuliaMono" "IBM Plex Mono" "Merriweather" "Alegreya"))

(defvar available-fonts
  (delete-dups (or (font-family-list)
                   (split-string (shell-command-to-string "fc-list : family")
                                 "[,\n]"))))

(defvar missing-fonts
  (delq nil (mapcar
             (lambda (font)
               (unless (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (f)
                                           (string-match-p (format "^%s$" font) f))
                                         available-fonts))
                 font))
             required-fonts)))

(if missing-fonts
    (pp-to-string
     `(unless noninteractive
        (add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook
          (run-at-time nil nil
                       (lambda ()
                         (message "%s missing the following fonts: %s"
                                  (propertize "Warning!" 'face '(bold warning))
                                  (mapconcat (lambda (font)
                                               (propertize font 'face 'font-lock-variable-name-face))
                                             ',missing-fonts
                                             ", "))
                         (sleep-for 0.5))))))
  ";; No missing fonts detected")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
<<detect-missing-fonts()>>
#+end_src

This way whenever fonts are missing, after Doom's UI has initialised, a warning
listing the missing fonts should appear for at least half a second.

**** Theme and modeline

~doom-one~ is nice and all, but I find the ~vibrant~ variant nicer. Oh, and with the
nice selection doom provides there's no reason for me to want the defaults.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-vibrant)
(remove-hook 'window-setup-hook #'doom-init-theme-h)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'doom-init-theme-h 'append)
(delq! t custom-theme-load-path)
#+end_src

However, by default ~red~ text is used in the ~modeline~, so let's make that orange
so I don't feel like something's gone /wrong/ when editing files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(doom-modeline-buffer-modified :foreground "orange"))
#+end_src

While we're modifying the modeline, =LF UTF-8= is the default file encoding, and
thus not worth noting in the modeline. So, let's conditionally hide it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding ()
  "We expect the encoding to be LF UTF-8, so only show the modeline when this is not the case"
  (setq-local doom-modeline-buffer-encoding
              (unless (and (memq (plist-get (coding-system-plist buffer-file-coding-system) :category)
                                 '(coding-category-undecided coding-category-utf-8))
                           (not (memq (coding-system-eol-type buffer-file-coding-system) '(1 2))))
                t)))

(add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook #'doom-modeline-conditional-buffer-encoding)
#+end_src

**** Miscellaneous
Relative line numbers are fantastic for knowing how far away line numbers are,
then =ESC 12 <UP>= gets you exactly where you think.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
#+end_src

I'd like some slightly nicer default buffer names
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-fallback-buffer-name "► Doom"
      +doom-dashboard-name "► Doom")
#+end_src

*** Some helper macros
There are a few handy macros added by doom, namely
- ~load!~ for loading external ~.el~ files relative to this one
- ~use-package!~ for configuring packages
- ~add-load-path!~ for adding directories to the ~load-path~ where ~Emacs~ looks when
  you load packages with ~require~ or ~use-package~
- ~map!~ for binding new keys

*** Allow babel execution in CLI actions

In this config I sometimes generate code to include in my config.
This works nicely, but for it to work with =doom sync= et. al. I need to make sure
that Org doesn't try to confirm that I want to allow evaluation (I do!).

Thankfully Doom supports =$DOOMDIR/cli.el= file which is sourced every time a CLI
command is run, so we can just enable evaluation by setting
~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ to ~nil~ there.
While we're at it, we should silence ~org-babel-execute-src-block~ to
avoid polluting the output.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el :comments no
;;; cli.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

(defun doom-shut-up-a (orig-fn &rest args)
  (quiet! (apply orig-fn args)))

(advice-add 'org-babel-execute-src-block :around #'doom-shut-up-a)
#+end_src
*** Elisp REPL

I think an elisp REPL sounds like a fun idea, even if not a particularly useful
one 😛. We can do this by adding a new command in =cli.el=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle cli.el
(defcli! repl ((in-rlwrap-p ["--rl"] "For internal use only."))
  "Start an elisp REPL."
  (when (and (executable-find "rlwrap") (not in-rlwrap-p))
    ;; For autocomplete
    (setq autocomplete-file "/tmp/doom_elisp_repl_symbols")
    (unless (file-exists-p autocomplete-file)
      (princ "\e[0;33mInitialising autocomplete list...\e[0m\n")
      (with-temp-buffer
        (cl-do-all-symbols (s)
          (let ((sym (symbol-name s)))
            (when (string-match-p "\\`[[:ascii:]][[:ascii:]]+\\'" sym)
              (insert sym "\n"))))
        (write-region nil nil autocomplete-file)))
    (princ "\e[F")
    (throw 'exit (list "rlwrap" "-f" autocomplete-file
                       (concat doom-emacs-dir "bin/doom") "repl" "--rl")))

  (doom-initialize-packages)
  (require 'engrave-faces-ansi)
  (setq engrave-faces-ansi-color-mode '3-bit)

  ;; For some reason (require 'parent-mode) doesn't work :(
  (defun parent-mode-list (mode)
    "Return a list of MODE and all its parent modes.

The returned list starts with the parent-most mode and ends with MODE."

Doom adds an =org-mode= hook ~+literate-enable-recompile-h~. This is a nice idea,

*** Dashboard quick actions

When using the dashboard, there are often a small number of actions I will take.
As the dashboard is it's own major mode, there is no need to suffer the tyranny
of unnecessary keystrokes --- we can simply bind common actions to a single key!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap ()
  (setq +doom-dashboard-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
  (map! :map +doom-dashboard-mode-map
        :desc "Find file" :ne "f" #'find-file
        :desc "Recent files" :ne "r" #'consult-recent-file
        :desc "Config dir" :ne "C" #'doom/open-private-config
        :desc "Open config.org" :ne "c" (cmd! (find-file (expand-file-name "config.org" doom-private-dir)))
        :desc "Open dotfile" :ne "." (cmd! (doom-project-find-file "~/.config/"))
        :desc "Notes (roam)" :ne "n" #'org-roam-node-find
        :desc "Switch buffer" :ne "b" #'+vertico/switch-workspace-buffer
        :desc "Switch buffers (all)" :ne "B" #'consult-buffer
        :desc "IBuffer" :ne "i" #'ibuffer
        :desc "Previous buffer" :ne "p" #'previous-buffer
        :desc "Set theme" :ne "t" #'consult-theme
        :desc "Quit" :ne "Q" #'save-buffers-kill-terminal
        :desc "Show keybindings" :ne "h" (cmd! (which-key-show-keymap '+doom-dashboard-mode-map))))

(add-transient-hook! #'+doom-dashboard-mode (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
(add-transient-hook! #'+doom-dashboard-mode :append (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
(add-hook! 'doom-init-ui-hook :append (+doom-dashboard-setup-modified-keymap))
#+end_src

Unfortunately the show keybindings help doesn't currently work as intended, but
this is still quite nice overall.

Now that the dashboard is so convenient, I'll want to make it easier to get to.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :leader :desc "Dashboard" "d" #'+doom-dashboard/open)
#+end_src

** Other things
*** Editor interaction
**** Mouse buttons
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :n [mouse-8] #'better-jumper-jump-backward
      :n [mouse-9] #'better-jumper-jump-forward)
#+end_src
*** Window title
I'd like to have just the buffer name, then if applicable the project folder
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (if (s-contains-p org-roam-directory (or buffer-file-name ""))
             (replace-regexp-in-string
              ".*/[0-9]*-?" "☰ "
              (subst-char-in-string ?_ ?  buffer-file-name))
           "%b"))
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

For example when I open my config file it the window will be titled =config.org ●
doom= then as soon as I make a change it will become =config.org ◉ doom=.
*** Splash screen
Emacs can render an image as the splash screen, and [[https://github.com/MarioRicalde][@MarioRicalde]] came up with a
cracker! He's also provided me with a nice Emacs-style /E/. I was using the
blackhole image, but as I've stripped down the splash screen I've switched to
just using the /E/.

#+attr_latex: :width 0.2\linewidth
#+attr_html: :style width:20% :alt Fancy Emacs "E"

Now the only thing missing is a an extra interesting line, whether that be some

The following is rather long, but it essentially

Lastly, the doom dashboard "useful commands" are no longer useful to me.
So, we'll disable them and then for a particularly /clean/ look disable
the modeline and ~hl-line-mode~, then also hide the cursor.

(remove-hook '+doom-dashboard-functions #'doom-dashboard-widget-shortmenu)

At the end, we have a minimal but rather nice splash screen.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt The splash screen, just loaded.

I haven't forgotten about the ASCII banner though! Once again we're going for
something simple.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun doom-dashboard-draw-ascii-emacs-banner-fn ()
  (let* ((banner
          '(",---.,-.-.,---.,---.,---."
            "|---'| | |,---||    `---."
            "`---'` ' '`---^`---'`---'"))
         (longest-line (apply #'max (mapcar #'length banner))))

     (dolist (line banner (point))
       (insert (+doom-dashboard--center

*** Systemd daemon
For running a systemd service for a Emacs server I have the following
#+name: emacsclient service
#+begin_src systemd :tangle ~/.config/systemd/user/emacs.service :mkdirp yes
[Unit]
Description=Emacs server daemon
Documentation=info:emacs man:emacs(1) https://gnu.org/software/emacs/

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=sh -c 'emacs --daemon && emacsclient -c --eval "(delete-frame)"'
ExecStop=/usr/bin/emacsclient --no-wait --eval "(progn (setq kill-emacs-hook nil) (kill emacs))"
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
#+end_src

which is then enabled by
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= "enabled\n" (shell-command-to-string "systemctl --user is-enabled emacs.service")) "no" "setup.sh")
systemctl --user enable emacs.service
#+end_src

For some reason if a frame isn't opened early in the initialisation process, the
daemon doesn't seem to like opening frames later --- hence the ~&& emacsclient~
part of the =ExecStart= value.

It can now be nice to use this as a 'default app' for opening files. If we add
an appropriate desktop entry, and enable it in the desktop environment.

#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/emacs-client.desktop :mkdirp yes
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Emacs client
GenericName=Text Editor
Comment=A flexible platform for end-user applications

StartupWMClass=Emacs

X-KDE-StartupNotify=false
#+end_src

When the daemon is running, I almost always want to do a few particular things
with it, so I may as well eat the load time at startup. We also want to keep
=mu4e= running.

It would be good to start the IRC client (=circe=) too, but that seems to have
issues when started in a non-graphical session.

Lastly, while I'm not sure quite why it happens, but after a bit it seems that
new Emacsclient frames start on the =*scratch*= buffer instead of the dashboard.
I prefer the dashboard, so let's ensure that's always switched to in new frames.

#+name: daemon initialisation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Emacs client wrapper
I frequently want to make use of Emacs while in a terminal emulator. To make
this easier, I can construct a few handy aliases.

However, a little convenience script in =~/.local/bin= can have the same effect,
be available beyond the specific shell I plop the alias in, then also allow me
to add a few bells and whistles --- namely:
+ Accepting stdin by putting it in a temporary file and immediately opening it.
+ Guessing that the =tty= is a good idea when ~$DISPLAY~ is unset (relevant with SSH
  sessions, among other things).
+ With a whiff of 24-bit color support, sets ~TERM~ variable to a =terminfo= that
  (probably) announces 24-bit color support.
+ Changes GUI =emacsclient= instances to be non-blocking by default (~--no-wait~),
  and instead take a flag to suppress this behaviour (~-w~).

I would use =sh=, but using arrays for argument manipulation is just too
convenient, so I'll raise the requirement to =bash=. Since arrays are the only
'extra' compared to =sh=, other shells like =ksh= etc. should work too.

*** Prompt to run setup script

At various points in this config, content is conditionally tangled to
=./setup.sh=. It's no good just putting content there if it isn't run though.
To help remind me to run it when needed, let's add a little prompt when there's
anything to be run.

#+name: run-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(if (file-exists-p "setup.sh")
    (if (string-empty-p (string-trim (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents "setup.sh") (buffer-string)) "#!/usr/bin/env bash"))

* Packages
** Loading instructions
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
This is where you install packages, by declaring them with the ~package!~ macro in
=packages.el=, then running ~doom refresh~ on the command line.
This file shouldn't be byte compiled.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "packages.el" :comments no
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
#+end_src

You'll then need to restart Emacs for your changes to take effect! Or at least,
run =M-x doom/reload=.

*Warning*: Don't disable core packages listed in =~/.emacs.d/core/packages.el=.
Doom requires these, and disabling them may have terrible side effects.

*** Packages in MELPA/ELPA/emacsmirror
To install ~some-package~ from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! some-package)
#+end_src

*** Packages from git repositories
To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
a ~:recipe~. You'll find documentation on what ~:recipe~ accepts [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format][here]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! another-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))
#+end_src

If the package you are trying to install does not contain a ~PACKAGENAME.el~
file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
~:files~ in the ~:recipe~:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! this-package
  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))
#+end_src

*** Disabling built-in packages
If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
you can do so here with the ~:disable~ property:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :disable t)
#+end_src
You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
all the properties for ~:recipe~. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))
#+end_src

Specify a ~:branch~ to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
#+end_src
** Convenience
*** Avy
#+begin_quote
From the =:config default= module.
#+end_quote


What a wonderful way to jump to buffer positions, and it uses the QWERTY
home-row for jumping. Very convenient ... except I'm using Colemak.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (= 0 (call-process "sh" nil nil nil "-c" "dmesg | grep -q 'ErgoDox'")) "yes" "no")
(after! avy
  ;; home row priorities: 8 6 4 5 - - 1 2 3 7
  (setq avy-keys '(?n ?e ?i ?s ?t ?r ?i ?a)))
#+end_src

*** Rotate (window management)
The =rotate= package just adds the ability to rotate window layouts, but that
sounds nice to me.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! rotate :pin "4e9ac3ff800880bd9b705794ef0f7c99d72900a6")
#+end_src

*** Emacs Everywhere
The name says it all. It's loaded and set up (a bit) by =:app everywhere=, however
as I develop this I want the unpinned version I have as a submodule.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! emacs-everywhere :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/emacs-everywhere"))
(unpin! emacs-everywhere)
#+end_src

Additionally, I'm going to make some personal choices that aren't made in the
Doom module.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! emacs-everywhere
  :if (daemonp)
  :config
  (require 'spell-fu)
  (setq emacs-everywhere-major-mode-function #'org-mode
        emacs-everywhere-frame-name-format "Edit ∷ %s — %s")
  (defadvice! emacs-everywhere-raise-frame ()
    :after #'emacs-everywhere-set-frame-name
    (setq emacs-everywhere-frame-name (format emacs-everywhere-frame-name-format
                                (emacs-everywhere-app-class emacs-everywhere-current-app)
                                (truncate-string-to-width
                                 (emacs-everywhere-app-title emacs-everywhere-current-app)
                                 45 nil nil "…")))
    ;; need to wait till frame refresh happen before really set
    (run-with-timer 0.1 nil #'emacs-everywhere-raise-frame-1))
  (defun emacs-everywhere-raise-frame-1 ()
    (call-process "wmctrl" nil nil nil "-a" emacs-everywhere-frame-name)))
#+end_src
*** Which-key
#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.
#+end_quote

Let's make this popup a bit faster
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5) ;; I need the help, I really do
#+end_src

I also think that having =evil-= appear in so many popups is a bit too verbose,
let's change that, and do a few other similar tweaks while we're at it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq which-key-allow-multiple-replacements t)
(after! which-key
  (pushnew!
   which-key-replacement-alist
   '(("" . "\\`+?evil[-:]?\\(?:a-\\)?\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◂\\1"))
   '(("\\`g s" . "\\`evilem--?motion-\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◃\\1"))
   ))

** Tools
*** Abbrev
Thanks to [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45462/use-a-single-abbrev-table-for-multiple-modes/45476#45476][use a single abbrev-table for multiple modes? - Emacs Stack Exchange]] I
have the following.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(add-hook 'doom-first-buffer-hook
          (defun +abbrev-file-name ()
            (setq-default abbrev-mode t)
            (setq abbrev-file-name (expand-file-name "abbrev.el" doom-private-dir))))
#+end_src

*** Very large files

The /very large files/ mode loads large files in chunks, allowing one to open
ridiculously large files.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! vlf :recipe (:host github :repo "m00natic/vlfi" :files ("*.el"))
  :pin "cc02f2533782d6b9b628cec7e2dcf25b2d05a27c" :disable t)
#+end_src

To make VLF available without delaying startup, we'll just load it in quiet moments.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! vlf-setup
  :defer-incrementally vlf-tune vlf-base vlf-write vlf-search vlf-occur vlf-follow vlf-ediff vlf)
#+end_src

*** Eros
#+begin_quote
From the =:tools eval= module.
#+end_quote

This package enables the very nice inline evaluation with =gr= and =gR=. The prefix
could be slightly nicer though.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq eros-eval-result-prefix "⟹ ") ; default =>
#+end_src

*** EVIL
#+begin_quote
From the =:editor evil= module.
#+end_quote

When I want to make a substitution, I want it to be global more often than not
--- so let's make that the default.

Now, EVIL cares a fair bit about keeping compatibility with Vim's default
behaviour. I don't. There are some particular settings that I'd rather be
something else, so let's change them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t     ; I like my s/../.. to by global by default
        evil-move-cursor-back nil       ; Don't move the block cursor when toggling insert mode
        evil-kill-on-visual-paste nil)) ; Don't put overwritten text in the kill ring
#+end_src

I don't use ~evil-escape-mode~, so I may as well turn it off, I've heard it
contributes a typing delay. I'm not sure it's much, but it is an extra
~pre-command-hook~ that I don't benefit from, so...
It seems that there's a dedicated package for this, so instead of just disabling
the mode on startup, let's prevent installation of the package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! evil-escape :disable t)
#+end_src

*** Consult
#+begin_quote
From the =:completion vertico= module.
#+end_quote

Since we're using [[Marginalia]] too, the separation between buffers and files is
already clear, and there's no need for a different face.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! consult
  (set-face-attribute 'consult-file nil :inherit 'consult-buffer)
  (setf (plist-get (alist-get 'perl consult-async-split-styles-alist) :initial) ";"))
#+end_src

*** Magit
#+begin_quote
From the =:tools magit= module.
#+end_quote

[[xkcd:1597]]

Magit is great as-is, thanks for making such a lovely package [[https://github.com/tarsius][Jonas]]!

**** Commit message templates

One little thing I want to add is some per-project commit message templates.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar +magit-project-commit-templates-alist nil
  "Alist of toplevel dirs and template strings/functions.")
(after! magit
  (defun +magit-fill-in-commit-template ()
    "Insert template from `+magit-fill-in-commit-template' if applicable."
    (when-let ((template (and (save-excursion (goto-char (point-min)) (string-match-p "\\`\\s-*$" (thing-at-point 'line)))
                              (cdr (assoc (file-name-base (directory-file-name (magit-toplevel)))
                                          +magit-project-commit-templates-alist)))))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (insert (if (stringp template) template (funcall template)))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (end-of-line)))
  (add-hook 'git-commit-setup-hook #'+magit-fill-in-commit-template 90))
#+end_src

This is particularly useful when creating commits for Org, as they need to
follow [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contribute.html#commit-messages][a certain format]] and sometimes I forget elements (oops!).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (add-to-list '+magit-project-commit-templates-alist (cons "org-mode" #'+org-commit-message-template)))
#+end_src

This relies on two small entries in the git config files which improves the hunk
heading line selection for elisp and Org files.
#+begin_src gitconfig
[diff "lisp"]
  xfuncname = "^(((;;;+ )|\\(|([ \t]+\\(((cl-|el-patch-)?def(un|var|macro|method|custom)|gb/))).*)$"

[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
#+end_src

*** Magit delta

[[https://github.com/dandavison/delta/][Delta]] is a git diff syntax highlighter written in rust. The author also wrote a
package to hook this into the magit diff view (which don't get any syntax
highlighting by default). This requires the ~delta~ binary. It's packaged on some
distributions, but most reliably installed through Rust's package manager cargo.

#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (or (not (executable-find "cargo")) (executable-find "delta")) "no" "setup.sh")
cargo install git-delta
#+end_src

Now we can make use of the package for this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
;; (package! magit-delta :recipe (:host github :repo "dandavison/magit-delta") :pin "56cdffd377279589aa0cb1df99455c098f1848cf")
#+end_src

All that's left is to hook it into magit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (after! magit
;;   (magit-delta-mode +1))
#+end_src
Unfortunately this currently seems to mess things up, which is something I'll
want to look into later.

*** Smerge

For repeated operations, a hydra would be helpful. But I prefer transient.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun smerge-repeatedly ()
  "Perform smerge actions again and again"
  (interactive)
  (smerge-mode 1)
  (smerge-transient))
(after! transient
  (transient-define-prefix smerge-transient ()
    [["Move"
      ("n" "next" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-next)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("p" "previous" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-prev)) (smerge-repeatedly)))]
     ["Keep"
      ("b" "base" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-keep-base)) (smerge-repeatedly)))

      ("k" "kill current" (lambda () (interactive) (ignore-errors (smerge-kill-current)) (smerge-repeatedly)))
      ("q" "quit" (lambda () (interactive) (smerge-auto-leave)))]]))
#+end_src

*** Company
#+begin_quote
From the =:completion company= module.
#+end_quote

It's nice to have completions almost all the time, in my opinion. Key strokes
are just waiting to be saved!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! company
  (setq company-idle-delay 0.5
        company-minimum-prefix-length 2)
  (setq company-show-numbers t)
  (add-hook 'evil-normal-state-entry-hook #'company-abort)) ;; make aborting less annoying.
#+end_src
Now, the improvements from ~precedent~ are mostly from remembering history, so
let's improve that memory.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default history-length 1000)
(setq-default prescient-history-length 1000)
#+end_src
**** Plain Text
~Ispell~ is nice, let's have it in ~text~, ~markdown~, and ~GFM~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-company-backend!
  '(text-mode
    markdown-mode
    gfm-mode)
  '(:seperate
    company-ispell
    company-files
    company-yasnippet))
#+end_src
We then configure the dictionary we're using in [[*Ispell][Ispell]].
**** ESS
~company-dabbrev-code~ is nice. Let's have it.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-company-backend! 'ess-r-mode '(company-R-args company-R-objects company-dabbrev-code :separate))
#+end_src
*** Projectile
#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.
#+end_quote

Looking at documentation via =SPC h f= and =SPC h v= and looking at the source can
add package src directories to projectile. This isn't desirable in my opinion.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq projectile-ignored-projects '("~/" "/tmp" "~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/"))
(defun projectile-ignored-project-function (filepath)
  "Return t if FILEPATH is within any of `projectile-ignored-projects'"
  (or (mapcar (lambda (p) (s-starts-with-p p filepath)) projectile-ignored-projects)))
#+end_src

*** Ispell
**** Downloading dictionaries
Let's get a nice big dictionary from [[http://app.aspell.net/create][SCOWL Custom List/Dictionary Creator]] with
the following configuration
- size :: 80 (huge)
- spellings :: British(-ise) and Australian
- spelling variants level :: 0
- diacritics :: keep
- extra lists :: hacker, roman numerals

***** Hunspell
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (file-exists-p "/usr/share/myspell/en-custom.dic") "no" "setup.sh")
cd /tmp
curl -o "hunspell-en-custom.zip" 'http://app.aspell.net/create?max_size=80&spelling=GBs&spelling=AU&max_variant=0&diacritic=keep&special=hacker&special=roman-numerals&encoding=utf-8&format=inline&download=hunspell'
unzip "hunspell-en-custom.zip"

sudo chown root:root en-custom.*
sudo mv en-custom.{aff,dic} /usr/share/myspell/
#+end_src
***** Aspell
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (file-expand-wildcards "/usr/lib64/aspell*/en-custom.multi") "no" "setup.sh")

tar -xjf "aspell6-en-custom.tar.bz2"

cd aspell6-en-custom
./configure && make && sudo make install
#+end_src
**** Configuration
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ispell-dictionary "en-custom")
#+end_src
Oh, and by the way, if ~company-ispell-dictionary~ is ~nil~, then
~ispell-complete-word-dict~ is used instead, which once again when ~nil~ is
~ispell-alternate-dictionary~, which at the moment maps to a plaintext version of
the above.

It seems reasonable to want to keep an eye on my personal dict, let's have it
nearby (also means that if I change the 'main' dictionary I keep my addition).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ispell-personal-dictionary (expand-file-name ".ispell_personal" doom-private-dir))
#+end_src
*** TRAMP

Another lovely Emacs feature, TRAMP stands for /Transparent Remote Access,
Multiple Protocol/. In brief, it's a lovely way to wander around outside your
local filesystem.

**** Prompt recognition

Unfortunately, when connecting to remote machines Tramp can be a wee pit picky
with the prompt format. Let's try to get Bash, and be a bit more permissive with
prompt recognition.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! tramp
  (setenv "SHELL" "/bin/bash")
  (setq tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "\\(?:^\\|\\)[^]#$%>\n]*#?[]#$%>] *\\(\\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z] *\\)*")) ;; default + 
#+end_src

**** Troubleshooting
In case the remote shell is misbehaving, here are some things to try

***** Zsh
There are some escape code you don't want, let's make it behave more considerately.
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle no
if [[ "$TERM" == "dumb" ]]; then
    unset zle_bracketed_paste
    unset zle
    PS1='$ '
    return
fi
#+end_src

**** Guix

[[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]] puts some binaries that TRAMP looks for in unexpected locations.
That's no problem though, we just need to help TRAMP find them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! tramp
  (appendq! tramp-remote-path
            '("~/.guix-profile/bin" "~/.guix-profile/sbin"
              "/run/current-system/profile/bin"
              "/run/current-system/profile/sbin")))
#+end_src
*** Auto activating snippets

Sometimes pressing =TAB= is just too much.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! aas :recipe (:host github :repo "ymarco/auto-activating-snippets")
  :pin "b1a436922ba06ab9e1a5cc222f1a4f25a7697231")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src

*** Screenshot

This makes it a breeze to take lovely screenshots.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! screenshot :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/screenshot"))
#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Example screenshot.el screenshot
[[https://tecosaur.com/lfs/emacs-config/screenshots/screenshot.png]]

Some light configuring is all we need, so we can make use of the [[https://github.com/Calinou/0x0][0x0]] wrapper
file uploading script (which I've renamed to ~upload~).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! screenshot
  :defer t
  :config (setq screenshot-upload-fn "upload %s 2>/dev/null"))
#+end_src

*** Etrace

The /Emacs Lisp Profiler/ (ELP) does a nice job recording information, but it
isn't the best for looking at results. =etrace= converts ELP's results to the
"Chromium Catapult Trace Event Format". This means that the output of =etrace= can
be loaded in something like the [[https://www.speedscope.app/][speedscope]] webapp for easier profile
investigation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! etrace :recipe (:host github :repo "aspiers/etrace"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(use-package! etrace
  :after elp)
#+end_src

*** YASnippet
#+begin_quote
From the =:editor snippets= module.
#+end_quote

Nested snippets are good, so let's enable that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq yas-triggers-in-field t)
#+end_src

*** String inflection

For when you want to change the case pattern for a symbol.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

** Visuals
*** Info colours
This makes manual pages nicer to look at by adding variable pitch fontification
and colouring 🙂.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :style width:80% :alt Example info-colours page.
[[https://tecosaur.com/lfs/emacs-config/screenshots/info-colours.png]]

(package! info-colors :pin "47ee73cc19b1049eef32c9f3e264ea7ef2aaf8a5")
#+end_src

To use this we'll just hook it into =Info=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! info-colors
  :commands (info-colors-fontify-node))

(add-hook 'Info-selection-hook 'info-colors-fontify-node)

*** Modus themes
Proteolas did a lovely job with the Modus themes, so much so that they were
welcomed into Emacs 28. However, he is also rather attentive with updates, and
so I'd like to make sure we have a recent version.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! modus-themes :pin "59422c05e00d65582a005ccb06c3767622d14e03")
#+end_src

*** Theme magic

With all our fancy Emacs themes, my terminal is missing out!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! theme-magic :pin "844c4311bd26ebafd4b6a1d72ddcc65d87f074e3")
#+end_src

This operates using =pywal=, which is present in some repositories, but most
reliably installed with =pip=.
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (executable-find "wal") "no" "setup.sh")
sudo python3 -m pip install pywal
#+end_src

Theme magic takes a look at a number of faces, the saturation levels, and colour
differences to try to cleverly pick eight colours to use. However, it uses the
same colours for the light variants, and doesn't always make the best picks.
Since we're using =doom-themes=, our life is a little easier and we can use the
colour utilities from Doom themes to easily grab sensible colours and generate
lightened versions --- let's do that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! theme-magic
  :commands theme-magic-from-emacs
  :config
  (defadvice! theme-magic--auto-extract-16-doom-colors ()
    :override #'theme-magic--auto-extract-16-colors
    (list
     (face-attribute 'default :background)
     (doom-color 'error)
     (doom-color 'success)
     (doom-color 'type)
     (doom-color 'keywords)
     (doom-color 'constants)
     (doom-color 'functions)
     (face-attribute 'default :foreground)
     (face-attribute 'shadow :foreground)
     (doom-blend 'base8 'error 0.1)
     (doom-blend 'base8 'success 0.1)
     (doom-blend 'base8 'type 0.1)
     (doom-blend 'base8 'keywords 0.1)
     (doom-blend 'base8 'constants 0.1)
     (doom-blend 'base8 'functions 0.1)
     (face-attribute 'default :foreground))))
#+end_src

*** Emojify
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui emoji= module.
#+end_quote


For starters, twitter's emojis look nicer than emoji-one.
Other than that, this is pretty great OOTB 😀.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq emojify-emoji-set "twemoji-v2")
#+end_src

One minor annoyance is the use of emojis over the default character
when the default is actually preferred. This occurs with overlay symbols I use
in Org mode, such as checkbox state, and a few other miscellaneous cases.

We can accommodate our preferences by deleting those entries from the emoji hash
table

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar emojify-disabled-emojis
  '(;; Org
    "◼" "☑" "☸" "⚙" "⏩" "⏪" "⬆" "⬇" "❓"
    ;; Terminal powerline
    "✔"
    ;; Box drawing
    "▶" "◀"
    ;; I just want to see this as text
    "©" "™")
  "Characters that should never be affected by `emojify-mode'.")

(defadvice! emojify-delete-from-data ()
  "Ensure `emojify-disabled-emojis' don't appear in `emojify-emojis'."
  :after #'emojify-set-emoji-data
  (dolist (emoji emojify-disabled-emojis)
    (remhash emoji emojify-emojis)))
#+end_src

Now, it would be good to have a minor mode which allowed you to type ascii/gh
emojis and get them converted to unicode. Let's make one.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun emojify--replace-text-with-emoji (orig-fn emoji text buffer start end &optional target)
  "Modify `emojify--propertize-text-for-emoji' to replace ascii/github emoticons with unicode emojis, on the fly."
  (if (or (not emoticon-to-emoji) (= 1 (length text)))
      (funcall orig-fn emoji text buffer start end target)
    (delete-region start end)
    (insert (ht-get emoji "unicode"))))

(define-minor-mode emoticon-to-emoji
  "Write ascii/gh emojis, and have them converted to unicode live."
  :global nil
  :init-value nil
  (if emoticon-to-emoji
      (progn
        (setq-local emojify-emoji-styles '(ascii github unicode))
        (advice-add 'emojify--propertize-text-for-emoji :around #'emojify--replace-text-with-emoji)
        (unless emojify-mode
          (emojify-turn-on-emojify-mode)))
    (setq-local emojify-emoji-styles (default-value 'emojify-emoji-styles))
    (advice-remove 'emojify--propertize-text-for-emoji #'emojify--replace-text-with-emoji)))
#+end_src

This new minor mode of ours will be nice for messages, so let's hook it in for
Email and IRC.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! '(mu4e-compose-mode org-msg-edit-mode circe-channel-mode) (emoticon-to-emoji 1))
#+end_src
*** Doom modeline
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui modeline= module.
#+end_quote


Very nice and pretty, however I think the PDF modeline could do with tweaking.
I raised [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline/pull/425][an issue]] on this, however the response was basically "put your
preferences in your personal config, the current default is sensible" --- so
here we are.

First up I'm going to want a segment for just the buffer file name, and a PDF
icon. Then we'll redefine two functions used to generate the modeline.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! doom-modeline
  (doom-modeline-def-segment buffer-name
    "Display the current buffer's name, without any other information."
    (concat

                         :v-adjust 0.02)))

  (defun doom-modeline-update-pdf-pages ()
    "Update PDF pages."
    (setq doom-modeline--pdf-pages
          (let ((current-page-str (number-to-string (eval `(pdf-view-current-page))))
                (total-page-str (number-to-string (pdf-cache-number-of-pages))))
            (concat
             (propertize
              (concat (make-string (- (length total-page-str) (length current-page-str)) ? )
                      " P" current-page-str)
              'face 'mode-line)
             (propertize (concat "/" total-page-str) 'face 'doom-modeline-buffer-minor-mode)))))

  (doom-modeline-def-segment pdf-pages
    "Display PDF pages."
    (if (doom-modeline--active) doom-modeline--pdf-pages
      (propertize doom-modeline--pdf-pages 'face 'mode-line-inactive)))

#+end_src
*** Keycast

For some reason, I find myself demoing Emacs every now and then. Showing what
keyboard stuff I'm doing on-screen seems helpful. While [[https://gitlab.com/screenkey/screenkey][screenkey]] does exist,
having something that doesn't cover up screen content is nice.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Screenshot of Keycast-mode in action

*** Screencast

In a similar manner to [[Keycast]], [[https://gitlab.com/ambrevar/emacs-gif-screencast][gif-screencast]] may come in handy.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

#+end_src

We can lazy load this using the start/stop commands.

I initially installed ~scrot~ for this, since it was the default capture program.
However it raised ~glib error: Saving to file ... failed~ each time it was run.
Google didn't reveal any easy fixed, so I switched to [[https://github.com/naelstrof/maim][maim]]. We now need to pass
it the window ID. This doesn't change throughout the lifetime of an emacs
instance, so as long as a single window is used ~xdotool getactivewindow~ will
give a satisfactory result.

It seems that when new colours appear, that tends to make ~gifsicle~ introduce
artefacts. To avoid this we pre-populate the colour map using the current doom
theme.

*** Mixed pitch
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui zen= module.
#+end_quote


We'd like to use mixed pitch in certain modes. If we simply add a hook, when
directly opening a file with (a new) Emacs =mixed-pitch-mode= runs before UI
initialisation, which is problematic. To resolve this, we create a hook that
runs after UI initialisation and both
+ conditionally enables =mixed-pitch-mode=
+ sets up the mixed pitch hooks

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mixed-pitch-modes '(org-mode LaTeX-mode markdown-mode gfm-mode Info-mode)
  "Modes that `mixed-pitch-mode' should be enabled in, but only after UI initialisation.")
(defun init-mixed-pitch-h ()
  "Hook `mixed-pitch-mode' into each mode in `mixed-pitch-modes'.
Also immediately enables `mixed-pitch-modes' if currently in one of the modes."
  (when (memq major-mode mixed-pitch-modes)
    (mixed-pitch-mode 1))
  (dolist (hook mixed-pitch-modes)
    (add-hook (intern (concat (symbol-name hook) "-hook")) #'mixed-pitch-mode)))
(add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'init-mixed-pitch-h)
#+end_src

As mixed pitch uses the variable =mixed-pitch-face=, we can create a new function
to apply mixed pitch with a serif face instead of the default. This was created
for writeroom mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(autoload #'mixed-pitch-serif-mode "mixed-pitch"
  "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch." t)

(after! mixed-pitch
  (defface variable-pitch-serif
    '((t (:family "serif")))
    "A variable-pitch face with serifs."
    :group 'basic-faces)
  (setq mixed-pitch-set-height t)
  (setq variable-pitch-serif-font (font-spec :family "Alegreya" :size 27))
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch-serif nil :font variable-pitch-serif-font)
  (defun mixed-pitch-serif-mode (&optional arg)
    "Change the default face of the current buffer to a serifed variable pitch, while keeping some faces fixed pitch."
    (interactive)
    (let ((mixed-pitch-face 'variable-pitch-serif))
      (mixed-pitch-mode (or arg 'toggle)))))
#+end_src

Now, as Harfbuzz is currently used in Emacs, we'll be missing out on the
following Alegreya ligatures:
#+begin_center
ff /ff/ ffi /ffi/ ffj /ffj/ ffl /ffl/
fft /fft/ fi /fi/ fj /fj/ ft /ft/
Th /Th/
#+end_center

Thankfully, it isn't to hard to add these to the ~composition-function-table~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?f '(["\\(?:ff?[fijlt]\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))
(set-char-table-range composition-function-table ?T '(["\\(?:Th\\)" 0 font-shape-gstring]))
#+end_src
*** Marginalia
#+begin_quote
Part of the =:completion vertico= module.
#+end_quote

Marginalia is nice, but the file metadata annotations are a little too plain.
Specifically, I have these gripes
+ File attributes would be nicer if coloured
+ I don't care about the user/group information if the user/group is me
+ When a file time is recent, a relative age (e.g. =2h ago=) is more useful than
  the date
+ An indication of file fatness would be nice

Thanks to the ~marginalia-annotator-registry~, we don't have to advise, we can
just add a new =file= annotator.

Another small thing is the face used for docstrings. At the moment it's =(italic
shadow)=, but I don't like that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Centaur Tabs
#+begin_quote
From the =:ui tabs= module.
#+end_quote


We want to make the tabs a nice, comfy size (~36~), with icons. The modifier
marker is nice, but the particular default Unicode one causes a lag spike, so
let's just switch to an ~o~, which still looks decent but doesn't cause any
issues.
An 'active-bar' is nice, so let's have one of those. If we have it ~under~ needs us to
turn on ~x-underline-at-decent~ though. For some reason this didn't seem to work
inside the src_elisp{(after! ... )} block ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
Then let's change the font to a sans serif, but the default one doesn't fit too
well somehow, so let's switch to 'P22 Underground Book'; it looks much nicer.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! centaur-tabs
  (centaur-tabs-mode -1)
  (setq centaur-tabs-height 36

#+end_src

*** All the icons
#+begin_quote
From the =:core packages= module.
#+end_quote


=all-the-icons= does a generally great job giving file names icons. One minor
niggle I have is that when /I/ open a =.m= file, it's much more likely to be Matlab
than Objective-C. As such, it'll be switching the icon associated with =.m=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! all-the-icons
  (setcdr (assoc "m" all-the-icons-extension-icon-alist)

*** Prettier page breaks

In some files, =^L= appears as a page break character. This isn't that visually
appealing, and Steve Purcell has been nice enough to make a package to display
these as horizontal rules.

*** Writeroom

For starters, I think Doom is a bit over-zealous when zooming in
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq +zen-text-scale 0.8)
#+end_src

Then, when using Org it would be nice to make a number of other aesthetic
tweaks. Namely:
+ Use a serifed variable-pitch font
+ Hiding headline leading stars
+ Using fleurons as headline bullets
+ Hiding line numbers
+ Removing outline indentation
+ Centring the text
+ Turning on ~org-pretty-table-mode~

amuse oneself. Introducing: typewriter sounds!

*** Wttrin

Hey, let's get the weather in here while we're at it.
Unfortunately this seems slightly unmaintained ([[https://github.com/bcbcarl/emacs-wttrin/pulls][few open bugfix PRs]]) so let's
roll our [[file:lisp/wttrin/wttrin.el][own version]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

Why not flash words on the screen. Why not --- hey, it could be fun.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! spray :pin "74d9dcfa2e8b38f96a43de9ab0eb13364300cb46")
#+end_src

It would be nice if Spray's default speed suited me better, and the keybindings
worked in evil mode. Let's do that and make the display slightly nicer while
we're at it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! spray

*** Elcord

What's even the point of using Emacs unless you're constantly telling everyone
about it?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el

#+end_src

** File types
*** Authinfo

My patch giving my patch giving =authinfo-mode= syntax highlighting is only
available in Emacs28+. For older versions, I've got a package I can use.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (< emacs-major-version 28) "packages.el" "no")
(package! authinfo-color-mode
  :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/authinfo-color-mode"))
#+end_src

Now we just need to load it appropriately.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (< emacs-major-version 28) "yes" "no")
(use-package! authinfo-color-mode
  :mode ("authinfo.gpg\\'" . authinfo-color-mode)
  :init (advice-add 'authinfo-mode :override #'authinfo-color-mode))
#+end_src

*** Systemd
For editing systemd unit files
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! systemd :pin "b6ae63a236605b1c5e1069f7d3afe06ae32a7bae")

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

* Applications
** Ebooks
[[xkcd:548]]

For managing my ebooks, I'll hook into the well-established ebook library
manager [[https://calibre-ebook.com/][calibre]]. A number of Emacs clients for this exist, but this seems like a
good option.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! calibredb :pin "cb93563d0ec9e0c653210bc574f9546d1e7db437")
#+end_src

Then for reading them, the only currently viable options seems to be [[https://depp.brause.cc/nov.el/][nov.el]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! nov :pin "2b4a7231aff6211a5a2f28719d830887aec6cc57")
#+end_src

Together these should give me a rather good experience reading ebooks.

** Calculator
Emacs includes the venerable =calc=, which is a pretty impressive RPN (Reverse
Polish Notation) calculator. However, we can do a bit to improve the experience.

*** Defaults

Any sane person prefers radians and exact values.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq calc-angle-mode 'rad  ; radians are rad
      calc-symbolic-mode t) ; keeps expressions like \sqrt{2} irrational for as long as possible
#+end_src

*** CalcTeX

Everybody knows that mathematical expressions look best with LaTeX, so =calc='s
ability to create LaTeX representations of its expressions provides a lovely
opportunity which is taken advantage of in the CalcTeX package.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! calctex :recipe (:host github :repo "johnbcoughlin/calctex"
                           :files ("*.el" "calctex/*.el" "calctex-contrib/*.el" "org-calctex/*.el" "vendor"))
  :pin "67a2e76847a9ea9eff1f8e4eb37607f84b380ebb")
#+end_src

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Demonstration of calc, prettified by calctex.
[[https://tecosaur.com/lfs/emacs-config/screenshots/calc-with-calctex.png]]

We'd like to use CalcTeX too, so let's set that up, and fix some glaring
inadequacies --- why on earth would you commit a hard-coded path to an executable
that /only works on your local machine/, consequently breaking the package for
everyone else!?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Embedded calc

Embedded calc is a lovely feature which let's us use calc to operate on LaTeX
maths expressions. The standard keybinding is a bit janky however (=C-x * e=), so
we'll add a localleader-based alternative.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map calc-mode-map
      :after calc
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :after org
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "E" #'calc-embedded)
(map! :map latex-mode-map
      :after latex
      :localleader
      :desc "Embedded calc (toggle)" "e" #'calc-embedded)
#+end_src

Unfortunately this operates without the (rather informative) calculator and
trail buffers, but we can advice it that we would rather like those in a side
panel.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar calc-embedded-trail-window nil)
(defvar calc-embedded-calculator-window nil)

(defadvice! calc-embedded-with-side-pannel (&rest _)
  :after #'calc-do-embedded
  (when calc-embedded-trail-window
    (ignore-errors
      (delete-window calc-embedded-trail-window))
    (setq calc-embedded-trail-window nil))
  (when calc-embedded-calculator-window
    (ignore-errors
      (delete-window calc-embedded-calculator-window))
    (setq calc-embedded-calculator-window nil))
  (when (and calc-embedded-info
             (> (* (window-width) (window-height)) 1200))
    (let ((main-window (selected-window))
          (vertical-p (> (window-width) 80)))
      (select-window
       (setq calc-embedded-trail-window
             (if vertical-p
                 (split-window-horizontally (- (max 30 (/ (window-width) 3))))
               (split-window-vertically (- (max 8 (/ (window-height) 4)))))))
      (switch-to-buffer "*Calc Trail*")
      (select-window
       (setq calc-embedded-calculator-window
             (if vertical-p
                 (split-window-vertically -6)
               (split-window-horizontally (- (/ (window-width) 2))))))
      (switch-to-buffer "*Calculator*")
      (select-window main-window))))

** IRC
=circe= is a client for IRC in Emacs (hey, isn't that a nice project
name+acronym), and a greek enchantress who turned humans into animals.

Let's use the former to chat to +recluses+ discerning individuals online.

[[xkcd:1782]]

Before we start seeing and sending messages, we need to authenticate with our
IRC servers. The circe manual provided a snippet for putting some of the auth
details in =.authinfo.gpg= --- but I think we should go further than that: have
the entire server info in our authinfo.

First, a reasonable format by which we can specify:
+ server
+ port
+ SASL username
+ SASL password
+ channels to join

We can have these stored like so
#+begin_src authinfo
machine chat.freenode.net login USERNAME password PASSWORD port PORT for irc channels emacs,org-mode
#+end_src

The ~for irc~ bit is used so we can uniquely identify all IRC auth info. By
omitting the =#= in channel names we can have a list of channels comma-separated
(no space!) which the secrets API will return as a single string.

#+name: irc-authinfo-reader
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defun auth-server-pass (server)
  (if-let ((secret (plist-get (car (auth-source-search :host server)) :secret)))
      (if (functionp secret)
          (funcall secret) secret)
    (error "Could not fetch password for host %s" server)))

(defun register-irc-auths ()
  (require 'circe)
  (require 'dash)
  (let ((accounts (-filter (lambda (a) (string= "irc" (plist-get a :for)))
                           (auth-source-search :require '(:for) :max 10))))
    (appendq! circe-network-options
              (mapcar (lambda (entry)
                        (let* ((host (plist-get entry :host))
                               (label (or (plist-get entry :label) host))
                               (_ports (mapcar #'string-to-number
                                               (s-split "," (plist-get entry :port))))
                               (port (if (= 1 (length _ports)) (car _ports) _ports))
                               (user (plist-get entry :user))
                               (nick (or (plist-get entry :nick) user))
                               (channels (mapcar (lambda (c) (concat "#" c))
                                                 (s-split "," (plist-get entry :channels)))))
                          `(,label
                            :host ,host :port ,port :nick ,nick

** Newsfeed
RSS feeds are still a thing. Why not make use of them with =elfeed=.
I really like what [[https://github.com/fuxialexander/doom-emacs-private-xfu/tree/master/modules/app/rss][fuxialexander]] has going on, but I don't think I need a custom
module. Let's just try to patch on the main things I like the look of.

** Dictionary
Doom already loads =define-word=, and provides it's own definition service using
[[https://github.com/gromnitsky/wordnut][wordnut]]. However, using an offline dictionary possess a few compelling
advantages, namely:
+ speed
+ integration of multiple dictionaries
[[http://goldendict.org/][GoldenDict]] seems like the best option currently available, but lacks a CLI.
Hence, we'll fall back to [[https://dushistov.github.io/sdcv/][sdcv]] (a CLI version of StarDict) for now.
To interface with this, we'll use a my =lexic= package.

#+attr_html: :class invertible :alt Screenshot of the lexic-mode view of "literate"
[[https://tecosaur.com/lfs/emacs-config/screenshots/lexic.png]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "sdcv") "packages.el" "no")
(package! lexic :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/lexic"))
#+end_src

Given that a request for a CLI is the [[https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict/issues/37][most upvoted issue]] on GitHub for
GoldenDict, it's likely we'll be able to switch from ~sdcv~ to that in the future.

Since GoldenDict supports StarDict files, I expect this will be a relatively
painless switch.

We start off by loading =lexic=, then we'll integrate it into pre-existing
definition functionality (like ~+lookup/dictionary-definition~).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "sdcv") "yes" "no")
(use-package! lexic
  :commands lexic-search lexic-list-dictionary
  :config
  (map! :map lexic-mode-map
        :n "q" #'lexic-return-from-lexic
        :nv "RET" #'lexic-search-word-at-point
        :n "a" #'outline-show-all
        :n "h" (cmd! (outline-hide-sublevels 3))
        :n "o" #'lexic-toggle-entry
        :n "n" #'lexic-next-entry
        :n "N" (cmd! (lexic-next-entry t))
        :n "p" #'lexic-previous-entry
        :n "P" (cmd! (lexic-previous-entry t))
        :n "E" (cmd! (lexic-return-from-lexic) ; expand
                     (switch-to-buffer (lexic-get-buffer)))
        :n "M" (cmd! (lexic-return-from-lexic) ; minimise
                     (lexic-goto-lexic))
        :n "C-p" #'lexic-search-history-backwards
        :n "C-n" #'lexic-search-history-forwards
        :n "/" (cmd! (call-interactively #'lexic-search))))
#+end_src

Now let's use this instead of wordnet.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "sdcv") "yes" "no")
(defadvice! +lookup/dictionary-definition-lexic (identifier &optional arg)
  "Look up the definition of the word at point (or selection) using `lexic-search'."
  :override #'+lookup/dictionary-definition
  (interactive
   (list (or (doom-thing-at-point-or-region 'word)
             (read-string "Look up in dictionary: "))
         current-prefix-arg))
  (lexic-search identifier nil nil t))
#+end_src

Lastly, I want to make sure I have some dictionaries set up. I've put a tarball
of dictionaries online which we can download if none seem to be present on the
system.
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (and (executable-find "sdsv") (not (file-exists-p (concat (or (getenv "STARDICT_DATA_DIR") (concat (or "~/.local/share" (getenv "XDG_DATA_HOME")) "/stardict")) "/dic")))) "setup.sh" "no")
DIC_FOLDER=${STARDICT_DATA_DIR:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/stardict}/dic
if [ ! -d "$DIC_FOLDER" ]; then
    TMP="$(mktemp -d /tmp/dict-XXX)"
    cd "$TMP"
    curl -A "Mozilla/4.0" -o "stardict.tar.gz" "https://tecosaur.com/resources/config/stardict.tar.gz"
    tar -xf "stardict.tar.gz"
    rm "stardict.tar.gz"
    mkdir -p "$DIC_FOLDER"
    mv * "$DIC_FOLDER"
fi
#+end_src

** Mail
[[xkcd:1467]]

*** Fetching
The contenders for this seem to be:
+ [[https://www.offlineimap.org/][OfflineIMAP]] ([[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OfflineIMAP][ArchWiki page]])
+ [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html][isync/mbsync]] ([[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/isync][ArchWiki page]])

From perusing r/emacs the prevailing opinion seems to be that
+ isync is faster
+ isync works more reliably
So let's use that.

The config was straightforward, and is located at [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]].
I'm currently successfully connecting to: Gmail, office365mail, and dovecot.
I'm also shoving passwords in my [[file:~/.authinfo.gpg][authinfo.gpg]] and fetching them using ~PassCmd~:
#+begin_src shell :tangle no :eval no
gpg2 -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d ~/.authinfo.gpg | awk '/machine IMAP_SERCER login EMAIL_ADDR/ {print $NF}'
#+end_src

We can run ~mbsync -a~ in a systemd service file or something, but we can do
better than that. [[https://github.com/vsemyonoff/easymail#usage][vsemyonoff/easymail]] seems like the sort of thing we want, but
is written for =notmuch= unfortunately. We can still use it for inspiration though.
Using [[https://gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify][goimapnotify]] we should be able to sync just after new
mail. Unfortunately this means /yet another/ config file :(

We install with
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (and (executable-find "mu") (not (executable-find "goimapnotify"))) "setup.sh" "no")
go get -u gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify
ln -s ~/.local/share/go/bin/goimapnotify ~/.local/bin/
#+end_src

Here's the general plan:
1. Use ~goimapnotify~ to monitor mailboxes
   This needs it's own set of configs, and =systemd= services, which is a pain. We
   remove this pain by writing a python script (found below) to setup these
   config files, and systemd services by parsing the  [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]] file.
2. On new mail, call ~mbsync --pull --new ACCOUNT:BOX~
   We try to be as specific as possible, so ~mbsync~ returns as soon as possible,
   and we can /get those emails as soon as possible/.
3. Try to call ~mu index --lazy-fetch~.
   This fails if mu4e is already open (due to a write lock on the database), so
   in that case we just ~touch~ a tmp file (=/tmp/mu_reindex_now=).
4. Separately, we set up Emacs to check for the existance of
   =/tmp/mu_reindex_now= once a second while mu4e is
   running, and (after deleting the file) call ~mu4e-update-index~.

Let's start off by handling the elisp side of things

**** Rebuild mail index while using mu4e
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! mu4e
  (defvar mu4e-reindex-request-file "/tmp/mu_reindex_now"

**** Config transcoding & service management
As long as the =mbsyncrc= file exists, this is as easy as running
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (and (executable-find "mu") (not (file-exists-p "~/.config/imapnotify"))) "setup.sh" "no")
~/.config/doom/misc/mbsync-imapnotify.py
#+end_src

When run without flags this will perform the following actions
+ Read, and parse [[file:~/.mbsyncrc][~/.mbsyncrc]], specifically recognising the following properties
  - ~IMAPAccount~
  - ~Host~
  - ~Port~
  - ~User~
  - ~Password~
  - ~PassCmd~
  - ~Patterns~
+ Call ~mbsync --list ACCOUNT~, and filter results according to ~Patterns~
+ Construct a imapnotify config for each account, with the following hooks
  - onNewMail :: src_shell{mbsync --pull ACCOUNT:MAILBOX}
  - onNewMailPost :: src_shell{if mu index --lazy-check; then test -f /tmp/mu_reindex_now && rm /tmp/mu_reindex_now; else touch /tmp/mu_reindex_now; fi}
+ Compare accounts list to previous accounts, enable/disable the relevant
  systemd services, called with the ~--now~ flag (start/stop services as well)

This script also supports the following flags
+ ~--status~ to get the status of the relevant systemd services supports =active=,
  =failing=, and =disabled=
+ ~--enable~ to enable all relevant systemd services
+ ~--disable~ to disable all relevant systemd services

**** Systemd
We then have a service file to run ~goimapnotify~ on all of these generated config files.
We'll use a template service file so we can enable a unit per-account.

Enabling the service is actually taken care of by that python script.

From one or two small tests, this can bring the delay down to as low as five
seconds, which I'm quite happy with.

This works well for fetching new mail, but we also want to propagate other
changes (e.g. marking mail as read), and make sure we're up to date at the
start, so for that I'll do the 'normal' thing and run ~mbsync -all~ every so often
--- let's say five minutes.

We can accomplish this via a systemd timer, and service file.
#+begin_src systemd :tangle (if (executable-find "mu") "~/.config/systemd/user/mbsync.timer" "no")

#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (or (not (executable-find "mu")) (string= "enabled\n" (shell-command-to-string "systemctl --user is-enabled mbsync.timer"))) "no" "setup.sh")
systemctl --user enable mbsync.timer --now

*** Indexing/Searching
This is performed by [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][Mu]]. This is a tool for finding emails stored in the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]] format.
According to the homepage, it's main features are
+ Fast indexing
+ Good searching
+ Support for encrypted and signed messages
+ Rich CLI tooling
+ accent/case normalisation
+ strong integration with email clients

Unfortunately ~mu~ is not currently packaged from me. Oh well, I guess I'm
building it from source then. I needed to install these packages
+ =gmime-devel=
+ =xapian-core-devel=

#+name: Install mu from source
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (and (file-directory-p "~/.mail") (not (executable-find "mu"))) "setup.sh" "no")
cd ~/.local/lib/
git clone https://github.com/djcb/mu.git
cd ./mu
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
#+end_src

To check how my version compares to the latest published:

#+begin_src shell :tangle no
curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/djcb/mu/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/'
mu --version | head -n 1 | sed 's/.* version //'
#+end_src

#+results:

*** Sending
[[https://www.nongnu.org/smtpmail/][SmtpMail]] seems to be the 'default' starting point, but that's not packaged for
me. [[https://marlam.de/msmtp/][msmtp]] is however, so I'll give that a shot. Reading around a bit (googling
"msmtp vs sendmail" for example) almost every comparison mentioned seems to
suggest msmtp to be a better choice. I have seen the following points raised
+ ~sendmail~ has several vulnerabilities
+ ~sendmail~ is tedious to configure
+ ~ssmtp~ is no longer maintained
+ ~msmtp~ is a maintained alternative to ~ssmtp~
+ ~msmtp~ is easier to configure

The config file is [[file:~/.config/msmtp/config][~/.config/msmtp/config]].

**** System hackery
Unfortunately, I seem to have run into a [[https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/44994][bug]] present in my packaged version, so
we'll just install the latest from source.

For full use of the ~auth~ options, I need =GNU SASL=, which isn't packaged for me.
I don't think I want it, but in case I do, I'll need to do this.
#+name: Install gsasl from source
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (and (executable-find "mu") (not (executable-find "msmtp"))) "setup.sh" "no")
export GSASL_VERSION=1.8.1
cd ~/.local/lib/
curl "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsasl/libgsasl-$GSASL_VERSION.tar.gz" | tar xz
curl "ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsasl/gsasl-$GSASL_VERSION.tar.gz" | tar xz
cd "./libgsasl-$GSASL_VERSION"
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
cd "./gsasl-$VERSION"
./configure
make
sudo make install
cd ..
#+end_src

Now actually compile ~msmtp~.
#+name: Install msmtp from source
#+begin_src shell :eval no :tangle (if (and (executable-find "mu") (not (executable-find "msmtp"))) "setup.sh" "no")
cd ~/.local/lib/
git clone https://github.com/marlam/msmtp-mirror.git ./msmtp
cd ./msmtp
libtoolize --force
aclocal
autoheader
automake --force-missing --add-missing
autoconf
# if using GSASL
# PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./configure --with-libgsasl
./configure
make
sudo make install
#+end_src

If using =GSASL= (from earlier) we need to make ensure that the dynamic library in
in the library path. We can do by adding an executable with the same name
earlier on in my ~$PATH~.
#+begin_src sh :tangle no :shebang "#!/bin/sh"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib exec /usr/local/bin/msmtp "$@"
#+end_src

:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no :noweb-ref mu4e-conf
:END:

Webmail clients are nice and all, but I still don't believe that SPAs in my
browser can replaced desktop apps ... sorry Gmail. I'm also liking google less
and less.

Mailspring is a decent desktop client, quite lightweight for electron
(apparently the backend is in =C=, which probably helps), however I miss Emacs
stuff.

While =Notmuch= seems very promising, and I've heard good things about it, it
doesn't seem to make any changes to the emails themselves. All data is stored in
Notmuch's database. While this is a very interesting model, occasionally I need
to pull up an email on say my phone, and so not I want the tagging/folders etc.
to be applied to the mail itself --- not stored in a database.

On the other hand =Mu4e= is also talked about a lot in positive terms, and seems
to possess a similarly strong feature set --- and modifies the mail itself (I.e.
information is accessible without the database). =Mu4e= also seems to have a large
user base, which tends to correlate with better support and attention.

As I installed mu4e from source, I need to add the =/usr/local/= loadpath so Mu4e has a chance of loading
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (file-directory-p "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e") "yes" "no")
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e")
#+end_src

Alternatively, I may need to add the =/usr/share/= path.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (file-directory-p "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e") "yes" "no")
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e")
#+end_src

Let's also just shove all the Elisp code here in an src_elisp{(after! ...)} block.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export :tangle yes :noweb-ref nil
(after! mu4e
  <<mu4e-conf>>
)
#+end_src

**** Viewing Mail
There seem to be some advantages with using Gnus' article view (such as inline
images), and judging from [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/pull/1442#issuecomment-591695814][djcb/mu!1442 (comment)]] this seems to be the 'way of
the future' for mu4e.

There are some all-the-icons font related issues, so we need to redefine the
fancy chars, and make sure they get the correct width.

To account for the increase width of each flag character, and make perform a
few more visual tweaks, we'll tweak the headers a bit
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq mu4e-headers-fields
      '((:flags . 6)
        (:account-stripe . 2)
        (:from-or-to . 25)
        (:folder . 10)
        (:recipnum . 2)
        (:subject . 80)
        (:human-date . 8))
      +mu4e-min-header-frame-width 142
      mu4e-headers-date-format "%d/%m/%y"
      mu4e-headers-time-format "⧖ %H:%M"
      mu4e-headers-results-limit 1000
      mu4e-index-cleanup t)

(add-to-list 'mu4e-bookmarks
             '(:name "Yesterday's messages" :query "date:2d..1d" :key ?y) t)

(defvar +mu4e-header--folder-colors nil)
(appendq! mu4e-header-info-custom
          '((:folder .
             (:name "Folder" :shortname "Folder" :help "Lowest level folder" :function
              (lambda (msg)
                (+mu4e-colorize-str
                 (replace-regexp-in-string "\\`.*/" "" (mu4e-message-field msg :maildir))
                 '+mu4e-header--folder-colors))))))
#+end_src

We'll also use a nicer alert icon
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq mu4e-alert-icon "/usr/share/icons/Papirus/64x64/apps/evolution.svg")
#+end_src
**** Sending Mail
Let's send emails too.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq sendmail-program "/usr/bin/msmtp"
      send-mail-function #'smtpmail-send-it
      message-sendmail-f-is-evil t
      message-sendmail-extra-arguments '("--read-envelope-from"); , "--read-recipients")
      message-send-mail-function #'message-send-mail-with-sendmail)
#+end_src

It's also nice to avoid accidentally sending emails with the wrong account. If
we can send from the address in the ~To~ field, let's do that. Opening a prompt
otherwise also seems sensible.

We can register Emacs as a potential email client with a desktop file. We could
put an =emacsclient ...= entry in the =Exec= field, but I've found this a bit dodgy.
Instead let's package the =emacslient= behaviour in a little executable
=~/.local/bin/emacsmail=.

#+begin_src shell :tangle ~/.local/bin/emacsmail :shebang "#!/usr/bin/env sh" :mkdirp yes :tangle-mode (identity #o755) :comments no
emacsclient -create-frame --alternate-editor='' --no-wait --eval \
"(progn (x-focus-frame nil) (mu4e-compose-from-mailto \"$1\" t))"
#+end_src

Now we can just call that in a desktop file.

#+begin_src conf :tangle ~/.local/share/applications/emacsmail.desktop :mkdirp yes
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Mu4e
GenericName=Compose a new message with Mu4e in Emacs
Comment=Open mu4e compose window
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/mailto;
Exec=emacsmail %u
Icon=emacs
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Categories=Network;Email;
StartupWMClass=Emacs
#+end_src

To register this, just call
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (or (not (executable-find "mu")) (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/mailto") "emacsmail.desktop\n")) "no" "setup.sh")
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications
#+end_src

We also want to define ~mu4e-compose-from-mailto~.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun mu4e-compose-from-mailto (mailto-string &optional quit-frame-after)
  (require 'mu4e)
  (unless mu4e~server-props (mu4e t) (sleep-for 0.1))
  (let* ((mailto (message-parse-mailto-url mailto-string))
         (to (cdr (assoc "To" mailto)))
         (subject (or (cdr (assoc "Subject" mailto)) ""))
         (body (cdr (assoc "Body" mailto)))
         (headers (-filter (lambda (spec) (not (-contains-p '("To" "Subject" "Body") (car spec)))) mailto)))
    (when-let ((mu4e-main (get-buffer mu4e-main-buffer-name)))
      (switch-to-buffer mu4e-main))
    (mu4e~compose-mail to subject headers)
    (when body
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (if (eq major-mode 'org-msg-edit-mode)
          (org-msg-goto-body)
        (mu4e-compose-goto-bottom))
      (insert body))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (cond ((null to) (search-forward "To: "))
          ((string= "" subject) (search-forward "Subject: "))
          (t (if (eq major-mode 'org-msg-edit-mode)
                 (org-msg-goto-body)
               (mu4e-compose-goto-bottom))))
    (font-lock-ensure)
    (when evil-normal-state-minor-mode
      (evil-append 1))
    (when quit-frame-after
      (add-hook 'kill-buffer-hook
                `(lambda ()
                   (when (eq (selected-frame) ,(selected-frame))
                     (delete-frame)))))))
#+end_src

It would also be nice to change the name pre-filled in =From:= when drafting.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar mu4e-from-name "Timothy"
  "Name used in \"From:\" template.")
(defadvice! mu4e~draft-from-construct-renamed (orig-fn)
  "Wrap `mu4e~draft-from-construct-renamed' to change the name."
  :around #'mu4e~draft-from-construct
  (let ((user-full-name mu4e-from-name))
    (funcall orig-fn)))
#+end_src

We can also use this a signature,
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq message-signature mu4e-from-name)
#+end_src
**** Working with the Org mailing list
***** Adding =X-Woof= headers

I'm fairly active on the Org mailing list (ML). The Org ML has a linked
bug/patch tracker, https://updates.orgmode.org/ managed by [[https://github.com/bzg/woof][Woof]]. However, I feel
like I spend too much time looking up what the appropriate headers are for
updating the status of bugs and patches. What I need, is some sort of convenient
tool. Let's write one.

First, a function that asks what I want to do and returns the appropriate =X-Woof=
header.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +mu4e-get-woof-header ()
  (pcase (read-char
          (format "\
%s
  %s Declare %s Applied %s Aborted
%s
  %s Confirm %s Fixed
%s
  %s Request %s Resolved

%s remove X-Woof header"
                  (propertize "Patch" 'face 'outline-3)
                  (propertize "p" 'face '(bold consult-key))
                  (propertize "a" 'face '(bold consult-key))
                  (propertize "c" 'face '(bold consult-key))
                  (propertize "Bug" 'face 'outline-3)
                  (propertize "b" 'face '(bold consult-key))
                  (propertize "f" 'face '(bold consult-key))
                  (propertize "Help" 'face 'outline-3)
                  (propertize "h" 'face '(bold consult-key))
                  (propertize "r" 'face '(bold consult-key))
                  (propertize "x" 'face '(bold error))))
    (?p "X-Woof-Patch: confirmed")
    (?a "X-Woof-Patch: applied")
    (?c "X-Woof-Patch: cancelled")
    (?b "X-Woof-Bug: confirmed")
    (?f "X-Woof-Bug: fixed")
    (?h "X-Woof-Help: confirmed")
    (?r "X-Woof-Help: cancelled")
    (?x 'delete)))
#+end_src

Now we just need a function which will add such a header to a buffer
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +mu4e-insert-woof-header ()
  "Insert an X-Woof header into the current message."
  (interactive)
  (when-let ((header (+mu4e-get-woof-header)))
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (search-forward "--text follows this line--")
      (unless (eq header 'delete)
        (beginning-of-line)
        (insert header "\n")
        (forward-line -1))
      (when (re-search-backward "^X-Woof-" nil t)
        (kill-whole-line)))))

(map! :map mu4e-compose-mode-map
      :localleader
      :desc "Insert X-Woof Header" "w" #'+mu4e-insert-woof-header)

(map! :map org-msg-edit-mode-map
      :after org-msg
      :localleader
      :desc "Insert X-Woof Header" "w" #'+mu4e-insert-woof-header)
#+end_src

Lovely! That should make adding these headers a breeze.

***** Patch workflow

Testing patches from the ML is currently more hassle than it needs to be. Let's
change that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun +org-ml-apply-patch (msg)

    (interactive)

    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Shell: Org apply patches*")
      (erase-buffer)

        (magit-refresh)

                                                   (plist-get entry :summary))
                         'face 'font-lock-keyword-face))
                (plist-get entry :id))))
           (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously "https://updates.orgmode.org/data/patches")
             (goto-char url-http-end-of-headers)
             (json-parse-buffer :object-type 'plist)))))

  (defun +org-ml-select-patch-thread ()

#+end_src

***** Mail list archive links

The other thing which it's good to be easily able to do is grab a link to the
current message on https://list.orgmode.org.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! mu4e
  (defun +mu4e-ml-message-link (msg)
    "Copy the link to MSG on the mailing list archives."
    (let* ((list-addr (or (mu4e-message-field msg :mailing-list)
                          (cdar (mu4e-message-field-raw msg :list-post))
                          (thread-last (append (mu4e-message-field msg :to)
                                               (mu4e-message-field msg :cc))
                            (mapcar #'last)
                            (mapcar #'cdr)
                            (mapcar (lambda (addr)

                                        (replace-regexp-in-string "@" "." addr))))
                            (delq nil)
                            (car))))
           (msg-url
            (cond
             ((string= "emacs-orgmode.gnu.org" list-addr)
              (format "https://list.orgmode.org/%s" (mu4e-message-field msg :message-id)))
             (t (user-error "Mailing list %s not supported" list-addr)))))

      msg-url))

  (add-to-list 'mu4e-view-actions (cons "link to message ML" #'+mu4e-ml-message-link) t))
#+end_src

In a similar manner, when clicking on such a link (say when someone uses a link
to the archive to refer to an earlier email) I'd much rather look at it in mu4e.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +browse-url-orgmode-ml (url &optional _)
  "Open an orgmode list url using notmuch."
  (let ((id (and (or (string-match "^https?://orgmode\\.org/list/\\([^/]+\\)" url)
                     (string-match "^https?://list\\.orgmode\\.org/\\([^/]+\\)" url))
                 (match-string 1 url))))
    (mu4e-view-message-with-message-id id)))

(add-to-list 'browse-url-handlers (cons "^https?://orgmode\\.org/list" #'+browse-url-orgmode-ml))
(add-to-list 'browse-url-handlers (cons "^https?://list\\.orgmode\\.org/" #'+browse-url-orgmode-ml))
#+end_src

Doom does a fantastic stuff with the defaults with this, so we only make a few
minor tweaks.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
* Language configuration
** General
*** File Templates
For some file types, we overwrite defaults in the [[file:./snippets][snippets]] directory, others
need to have a template assigned.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(set-file-template! "/LICEN[CS]E$" :trigger '+file-templates/insert-license)
#+end_src
** Plaintext
It's nice to see ANSI colour codes displayed. However, until Emacs 28 it's not
possible to do this without modifying the buffer, so let's condition this block
on that.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (>= emacs-major-version 28) "yes" "no")
(after! text-mode

Beyond the elegance in the markup language, tremendously rich integrations with
Emacs allow for some fantastic [[https://orgmode.org/features.html][features]], such as what seems to be the best
support for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] of any currently available technology.

An =.org= file can contain blocks of code (with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb][noweb]] templating support), which
can be [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][tangled]] to dedicated source code files, and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][woven]] into a document
(report, documentation, presentation, etc.) through various (/extensible/) methods.
These source blocks may even create images or other content to be included in
the document, or generate source code.

Finally, because this section is fairly expensive to initialise, we'll wrap it
in an src_elisp{(after! ...)} block.

*** System config
**** Mime types
Org mode isn't recognised as it's own mime type by default, but that can easily
be changed with the following file. For system-wide changes try
~/usr/share/mime/packages/org.xml~.
#+begin_src xml :tangle ~/.local/share/mime/packages/org.xml :mkdirp yes :comments no
<mime-info xmlns='http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info'>
  <mime-type type="text/org">
    <comment>Emacs Org-mode File</comment>
    <glob pattern="*.org"/>
    <alias type="text/org"/>
  </mime-type>
</mime-info>

What's nice is that Papirus [[https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/commit/a10fb7f2423d5e30b9c4477416ccdc93c4f3849d][now]] has an icon for =text/org=.
One simply needs to refresh their mime database
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "") "setup.sh" "no")
update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime
#+end_src
Then set Emacs as the default editor
#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (string= (shell-command-to-string "xdg-mime query default text/org") "emacs-client.desktop\n") "no" "setup.sh")
xdg-mime default emacs.desktop text/org

**** Git diffs
Protesilaos wrote a [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-01-26-git-diff-hunk-elisp-org/][very helpful article]] in which he explains how to change the
git diff chunk heading to something more useful than just the immediate line
above the hunk --- like the parent heading.

This can be achieved by first adding a new diff mode to git in =~/.config/git/attributes=
#+begin_src fundamental
,*.org   diff=org
#+end_src

Then adding a regex for it to =~/.config/git/config=
#+begin_src gitconfig
[diff "org"]
  xfuncname = "^(\\*+ +.*)$"
#+end_src

****  Org itself
There are actually three possible package statements I may want to use for Org.

If I'm on a machine where I can push changes, I want to be able to develop Org.
I can check this by checking the content of the SSH key =~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub=.
1. If this key exists and there isn't a repo at
   =$straight-base-dir/straight/repos/org-mode= with the right remote, we should
   install it as such.
2. If the key exists and repo are both set up, the package should just be ignored.
3. If the key does not exist, the Org's ~HEAD~ should just be used

To account for this situation properly, we need a short script to determine the
correct package statement needed.

#+end_src

**** Visuals
***** Tables

Org tables aren't the prettiest thing to look at. This package is supposed to
redraw them in the buffer with box-drawing characters. Sounds like an
improvement to me! We'll make use of this with =writeroom-mode=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-pretty-table
  :recipe (:host github :repo "Fuco1/org-pretty-table") :pin "7bd68b420d3402826fea16ee5099d04aa9879b78")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! org-pretty-table
  :commands (org-pretty-table-mode global-org-pretty-table-mode))
#+end_src

***** Emphasis markers
While ~org-hide-emphasis-markers~ is very nice, it can sometimes make edits which
occur at the border a bit more fiddley. We can improve this situation without
sacrificing visual amenities with the =org-appear= package.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-appear :recipe (:host github :repo "awth13/org-appear")
  :pin "303fcc8d5d85a4ebff2798dab50b2ccc0255ea5f")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! org-appear
  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-appear-autoemphasis t
        org-appear-autosubmarkers t
        org-appear-autolinks nil)
  ;; for proper first-time setup, `org-appear--set-elements'
  ;; needs to be run after other hooks have acted.
  (run-at-time nil nil #'org-appear--set-elements))
#+end_src

***** Heading structure
Speaking of headlines, a nice package for viewing and managing the heading
structure has come to my attention.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-ol-tree :recipe (:host github :repo "Townk/org-ol-tree")
  :pin "207c748aa5fea8626be619e8c55bdb1c16118c25")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! org-ol-tree
  :commands org-ol-tree)
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :after org
      :localleader
      :desc "Outline" "O" #'org-ol-tree)
#+end_src

**** Extra functionality

***** Org ref

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(package! org-ref :pin "3ca9beb744621f007d932deb8a4197467012c23a")
#+end_src

***** Julia support
=ob-julia= is currently a bit borked, but there's an effort to improve this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! ob-julia :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/ob-julia" :files ("*.el" "julia")))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! ob-julia
  :commands org-babel-execute:julia
  :config
  (setq org-babel-julia-command-arguments
        `("--sysimage"
          ,(when-let ((img "~/.local/lib/julia.so")
                      (exists? (file-exists-p img)))
             (expand-file-name img))
          "--threads"
          ,(number-to-string (- (doom-system-cpus) 2))
          "--banner=no")))
#+end_src
***** HTTP requests

I like the idea of being able to make HTTP requests with Babel.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! ob-http :pin "b1428ea2a63bcb510e7382a1bf5fe82b19c104a7")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! ob-http
  :commands org-babel-execute:http)
#+end_src

***** Transclusion
There's a really cool package in development to /transclude/ Org document content.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-transclusion :recipe (:host github :repo "nobiot/org-transclusion")
  :pin "ccc0aaa72732ea633bf52bcc8a0345cd3ac178fd")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! org-transclusion
  :commands org-transclusion-mode
  :init
  (map! :after org :map org-mode-map
        "<f12>" #'org-transclusion-mode))
#+end_src

***** Heading graph
Came across this and ... it's cool
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-graph-view :recipe (:host github :repo "alphapapa/org-graph-view") :pin "233c6708c1f37fc60604de49ca192497aef39757")
#+end_src

***** Cooking recipes
I *need* this in my life. It take a URL to a recipe from a common site, and
inserts an org-ified version at point. Isn't that just great.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-chef :pin "87e9a6c4844ff32f47c8d1108ec0f087a3148a8e")
#+end_src

Loading after org seems a bit premature. Let's just load it when we try to use
it, either by command or in a capture template.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! org-chef
  :commands (org-chef-insert-recipe org-chef-get-recipe-from-url))
#+end_src

***** Importing with Pandoc

Sometimes I'm given non-org files, that's very sad. Luckily Pandoc offers a way
to make that right again, and this package makes that even easier to do.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-pandoc-import :recipe
  (:local-repo "lisp/org-pandoc-import" :files ("*.el" "filters" "preprocessors")))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! org-pandoc-import
  :after org)
#+end_src

***** Document comparison
It's quite nice to compare Org files, and the richest way to compare content is
probably =latexdiff=. There are a few annoying steps involved here, and so I've
written a package to streamline the process.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! orgdiff :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/orgdiff"))
#+end_src

The only little annoyance is the fact that =latexdiff= uses ~#FF0000~ and ~#0000FF~ as
the red/blue change indication colours. We can make this a bit nicer by
post-processing the =latexdiff= result.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! orgdiff
  :defer t
  :config
  (defun +orgdiff-nicer-change-colours ()
    (goto-char (point-min))
    ;; Set red/blue based on whether chameleon is being used
    (if (search-forward "%% make document follow Emacs theme" nil t)
        (setq red  (substring (doom-blend 'red 'fg 0.8) 1)
              blue (substring (doom-blend 'blue 'teal 0.6) 1))
      (setq red  "c82829"
            blue "00618a"))
    (when (and (search-forward "%DIF PREAMBLE EXTENSION ADDED BY LATEXDIFF" nil t)
               (search-forward "\\RequirePackage{color}" nil t))
      (when (re-search-forward "definecolor{red}{rgb}{1,0,0}" (cdr (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'line)) t)
        (replace-match (format "definecolor{red}{HTML}{%s}" red)))
      (when (re-search-forward "definecolor{blue}{rgb}{0,0,1}" (cdr (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'line)) t)
        (replace-match (format "definecolor{blue}{HTML}{%s}" blue)))))
  (add-to-list 'orgdiff-latexdiff-postprocess-hooks #'+orgdiff-nicer-change-colours))
#+end_src

***** Org music
It's nice to be able to link to music
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! org-music :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/org-music"))
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(use-package! org-music
  :after org
  :config
  (setq org-music-mpris-player "Lollypop"
        org-music-track-search-method 'beets
        org-music-beets-db "~/Music/library.db"))
#+end_src

*** Behaviour
[[xkcd:1319]]
**** Tweaking defaults
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-directory "~/.org"                      ; let's put files here
      org-use-property-inheritance t              ; it's convenient to have properties inherited
      org-log-done 'time                          ; having the time a item is done sounds convenient
      org-list-allow-alphabetical t               ; have a. A. a) A) list bullets
      org-export-in-background t                  ; run export processes in external emacs process
      org-catch-invisible-edits 'smart            ; try not to accidently do weird stuff in invisible regions
      org-export-with-sub-superscripts '{})       ; don't treat lone _ / ^ as sub/superscripts, require _{} / ^{}
#+end_src
I also like the src_elisp{:comments} header-argument, so let's make that a
default.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-default-header-args
      '((:session . "none")
        (:results . "replace")
        (:exports . "code")
        (:cache . "no")
        (:noweb . "no")
        (:hlines . "no")
        (:tangle . "no")
        (:comments . "link")))
#+end_src

By default, ~visual-line-mode~ is turned =on=, and ~auto-fill-mode~ =off= by a hook.
However this messes with tables in Org-mode, and other plaintext files (e.g.
markdown, \LaTeX) so I'll turn it off for this, and manually enable it for more
specific modes as desired.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(remove-hook 'text-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'auto-fill-mode)
#+end_src

There also seem to be a few keybindings which use =hjkl=, but miss arrow key equivalents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map evil-org-mode-map
      :after evil-org
      :n "g <up>" #'org-backward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <down>" #'org-forward-heading-same-level
      :n "g <left>" #'org-up-element
      :n "g <right>" #'org-down-element)
#+end_src
**** Extra functionality
***** Org buffer creation
Let's also make creating an org buffer just that little bit easier.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes :noweb-ref none
(evil-define-command evil-buffer-org-new (count file)
  "Creates a new ORG buffer replacing the current window, optionally
   editing a certain FILE"
  :repeat nil
  (interactive "P<f>")
  (if file
      (evil-edit file)
    (let ((buffer (generate-new-buffer "*new org*")))
      (set-window-buffer nil buffer)
      (with-current-buffer buffer
        (org-mode)))))
(map! :leader
      (:prefix "b"
       :desc "New empty ORG buffer" "o" #'evil-buffer-org-new))
#+end_src
***** The utility of zero-width spaces
Occasionally in Org you run into annoyances where you want to have two seperate
blocks right together without a space. For example, to *emp​h*​asise part of a word,
or put a currency symbol immediately before an inline source block.
There is a solution to this, it just sounds slightly hacky --- zero width spaces.
Because this is Emacs, we can make this feel much less hacky by making a minor
addition to the Org key map 🙂.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :nie "M-SPC M-SPC" (cmd! (insert "\u200B")))
#+end_src

We then want to stop the space from being included in exports, which can be done
with a little filter.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-export-remove-zero-width-space (text _backend _info)
  "Remove zero width spaces from TEXT."
  (unless (org-export-derived-backend-p 'org)
    (replace-regexp-in-string "\u200B" "" text)))

(after! ox
  (add-to-list 'org-export-filter-final-output-functions #'+org-export-remove-zero-width-space t))
#+end_src
***** List bullet sequence
I think it makes sense to have list bullets change with depth
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-list-demote-modify-bullet '(("+" . "-") ("-" . "+") ("*" . "+") ("1." . "a.")))
#+end_src
***** Citation
Occasionally I want to cite something, and =org-ref= is /the/ package for that.

Unfortunately, it ignores the ~file = {...}~ =.bib= keys though. Let's fix that.
I separate files on =;=, which may just be a Zotero/BetterBibLaTeX thing, but it's
a good idea in my case at least.

**** Nicer generated heading IDs
Thanks to alphapapa's [[https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el#export-to-html-with-useful-anchors][unpackaged.el]].

By default, Org generated heading IDs like =#org80fc2a5= which ... works, but has
two issues
+ It's completely uninformative, I have no idea what's being referenced
+ If I export the same file, everything will change.
  Now, while without hardcoded values it's impossible to set references in
  stone, it would be nice for there to be a decent chance of staying the same.

Both of these issues can be addressed by generating IDs like
=#language-configuration=, which is what I'll do here.

It's worth noting that alphapapa's use of ~url-hexify-string~ seemed to cause me
some issues. Replacing that in ~a53899~ resolved this for me. To go one step
further, I create a function for producing nice short links, like an inferior
version of ~reftex-label~.

the number of characters in the budget freed by short words is distributed among the words
exceeding the average length.  This adjusts the per-word budget to be the maximum feasable for
this particular situation, rather than the universal maximum average.

This budget-adjusted per-word maximum length is given by the mathematical expression below:

**** Snippet Helpers

I often want to set =src-block= headers, and it's a pain to
+ type them out
+ remember what the accepted values are
+ oh, and specifying the same language again and again

We can solve this in three steps
+ having one-letter snippets, conditioned on ~(point)~ being within a src header
+ creating a nice prompt showing accepted values and the current default
+ pre-filling the =src-block= language with the last language used

For header args, the keys I'll use are
+ =r= for =:results=
+ =e= for =:exports=
+ =v= for =:eval=
+ =s= for =:session=
+ =d= for =:dir=

**** Flycheck with org-lint

Org may be simple, but that doesn't mean there's no such thing as malformed Org.
Thankfully, malformed Org is a much less annoying affair than malformed zipped
XML (looks at DOCX/ODT...), particularly because there's a rather helpful little
tool called ~org-lint~ bundled with Org that can tell you about your mistakes.

[[xkcd:2109]]

Flycheck doesn't currently support Org, and there's aren't any packages to do so
☹. However, in an issue on ~org-lint~ there is [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/1757#issuecomment-759546940][some code]] which apparently works.
Surely this is what the clipboard was invented for? With that said, let's
regurgitate the code, cross our fingers, and hope it works.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defconst flycheck-org-lint-form
  (flycheck-prepare-emacs-lisp-form

            (princ (elt inf 0))
            (princ ": ")
            (princ (elt inf 2))
            (terpri)))))))

  "Variables inherited by the org-lint subprocess.")

     ,@(seq-map (lambda (opt) `(setq-default ,opt ',(symbol-value opt)))
                (seq-filter #'boundp flycheck-org-lint-variables))))

(flycheck-define-checker org-lint
  "Org buffer checker using `org-lint'."
  :command ("emacs" (eval flycheck-emacs-args)
            "--eval" (eval (concat "(add-to-list 'load-path \""
                                   (file-name-directory (locate-library "org"))
                                   "\")"))
            "--eval" (eval (flycheck-sexp-to-string
                            (flycheck-org-lint-variables-form)))
            "--eval" (eval (flycheck-sexp-to-string

            "--" source)
  :error-patterns
  ((error line-start line ": " (message) line-end))

#+end_src

Turns out it almost works. Running =M-x flycheck-verify-setup= after running that
snippet produces the following:
#+begin_example
The following syntax checkers are not registered:
  - org-lint
Try adding these syntax checkers to `flycheck-checkers'.
#+end_example

Well that's very nice and helpful. We'll just do that 🙂.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'flycheck-checkers 'org-lint)
#+end_src

It was missing custom link types, but that's easily fixed just by adding
~org-link-parameters~ to ~flycheck-org-lint-variables~.

One remaining little annoyance is that it reports extra =#+options= that I've
added to Org as errors. So we need to tell ~org-lint~ about them without having it
load my whole config. Code duplication isn't great, but at least this isn't
much.

*** Visuals

Here I try to do two things: improve the styling of the various documents, via
font changes etc, and also propagate colours from the current theme.

[[xkcd:1882]]

**** Font Display
Mixed pitch is great. As is ~+org-pretty-mode~, let's use them.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'+org-pretty-mode)
#+end_src

Let's make headings a bit bigger
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(outline-1 :weight extra-bold :height 1.25)
  '(outline-2 :weight bold :height 1.15)
  '(outline-3 :weight bold :height 1.12)
  '(outline-4 :weight semi-bold :height 1.09)
  '(outline-5 :weight semi-bold :height 1.06)
  '(outline-6 :weight semi-bold :height 1.03)
  '(outline-8 :weight semi-bold)
  '(outline-9 :weight semi-bold))
#+end_src

And the same with the title.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!
  '(org-document-title :height 1.2))
#+end_src

It seems reasonable to have deadlines in the error face when they're passed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-deadline-faces
      '((1.001 . error)
        (1.0 . org-warning)
        (0.5 . org-upcoming-deadline)
        (0.0 . org-upcoming-distant-deadline)))
#+end_src

We can then have quote blocks stand out a bit more by making them /italic/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
#+end_src

Org files can be rather nice to look at, particularly with some of the
customisations here. This comes at a cost however, expensive font-lock.
Feeling like you're typing through molasses in large files is no fun, but there
is a way I can defer font-locking when typing to make the experience more
responsive.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun locally-defer-font-lock ()
  "Set jit-lock defer and stealth, when buffer is over a certain size."
  (when (> (buffer-size) 50000)
    (setq-local jit-lock-defer-time 0.05
                jit-lock-stealth-time 1)))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'locally-defer-font-lock)
#+end_src
Apparently this causes issues with some people, but I haven't noticed anything
problematic beyond the expected slight delay in some fontification, so until I
do I'll use the above.

**** Fontifying inline src blocks
Org does lovely things with =#+begin_src= blocks, like using font-lock for
language's major-mode behind the scenes and pulling out the lovely colourful
results. By contrast, inline =src_= blocks are somewhat neglected.

I am not the first person to feel this way, thankfully others have [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20309842/how-to-syntax-highlight-for-org-mode-inline-source-code-src-lang/28059832][taken to
stackexchange]] to voice their desire for inline src fontification. I was going to
steal their work, but unfortunately they didn't perform /true/ source code
fontification, but simply applied the =org-code= face to the content.

We can do better than that, and we shall! Using ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~
we can apply language-appropriate syntax highlighting. Then, continuing on to
={{{results(...)}}}= , it can have the =org-block= face applied to match, and then
the value-surrounding constructs hidden by mimicking the behaviour of
~prettify-symbols-mode~.

#+begin_warning
This currently only highlights a single inline src block per line.
I have no idea why it stops, but I'd rather it didn't.
If you have any idea what's going on or how to fix this /please/ get in touch.

It's also nice to change the character used for collapsed items (by default ~…~),
I think ~▾~ is better for indicating 'collapsed section'.
and add an extra ~org-bullet~ to the default list of four.
I've also added some fun alternatives, just commented out.

**** LaTeX Fragments
***** Prettier highlighting
First off, we want those fragments to look good.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-highlight-latex-and-related '(native script entities))
#+end_src

However, by using =native= highlighting the =org-block= face is added, and that
doesn't look too great --- particularly when the fragments are previewed.

Ideally ~org-src-font-lock-fontify-block~ wouldn't add the =org-block= face, but we
can avoid advising that entire function by just adding another face with
=:inherit default= which will override the background colour.

Inspecting ~org-do-latex-and-related~ shows that ="latex"= is the language argument
passed, and so we can override the background as discussed above.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-src)
(add-to-list 'org-src-block-faces '("latex" (:inherit default :extend t)))
#+end_src

***** More eager rendering
What's better than syntax-highlighted LaTeX is /rendered/ LaTeX though, and we can
have this be performed automatically with =org-fragtog=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! org-fragtog :pin "680606189d5d28039e6f9301b55ec80517a24005")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle yes
(use-package! org-fragtog
  :hook (org-mode . org-fragtog-mode))
#+end_src

***** Prettier rendering
It's nice to customise the look of LaTeX fragments so they fit better in the
text --- like this \(\sqrt{\beta^2+3}-\sum_{\phi=1}^\infty \frac{x^\phi-1}{\Gamma(a)}\).
Let's start by adding a sans font. I'd also like to use some of the
functionality from =bmc-maths=, so we'll load that too.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-header "\\documentclass{article}
\\usepackage[usenames]{xcolor}

\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

\\usepackage{booktabs}

\\pagestyle{empty}             % do not remove
% The settings below are copied from fullpage.sty
\\setlength{\\textwidth}{\\paperwidth}
\\addtolength{\\textwidth}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\oddsidemargin}{-2.54cm}
\\setlength{\\evensidemargin}{\\oddsidemargin}
\\setlength{\\textheight}{\\paperheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headheight}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\headsep}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-\\footskip}
\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-3cm}
\\setlength{\\topmargin}{1.5cm}
\\addtolength{\\topmargin}{-2.54cm}
% my custom stuff
\\usepackage[nofont,plaindd]{bmc-maths}
\\usepackage{arev}
")
#+end_src

Since we can, instead of making the background colour match the =default= face,
let's make it transparent.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-format-latex-options
      (plist-put org-format-latex-options :background "Transparent"))
#+end_src

***** Rendering speed tests
We can either render from a ~dvi~ or ~pdf~ file, so let's benchmark ~latex~ and
~pdflatex~.
| ~latex~ time | ~pdflatex~ time |
|------------+---------------|
| 135 \pm 2 ms | 215 \pm 3 ms    |

On the rendering side, there are two ~.dvi~-to-image converters which I am
interested in: ~dvipng~ and ~dvisvgm~. Then with the a ~.pdf~ we have ~pdf2svg~.
For inline preview we care about speed, while for exporting we care about file
size and prefer a vector graphic.

Using the above latex expression and benchmarking lead to the following results:
| ~dvipng~ time | ~dvisvgm~ time | ~pdf2svg~ time |
|-------------+--------------+--------------|
| 89 \pm 2 ms   | 178 \pm 2 ms   | 12 \pm 2 ms    |

Now let's combine this to see what's best
| Tool chain         | Total time | Resultant file size |
|--------------------+------------+---------------------|
| ~latex~ + ~dvipng~     | 226 \pm 2 ms | 7 KiB               |
| ~latex~ + ~dvisvgm~    | 392 \pm 4 ms | 8 KiB               |
| ~pdflatex~ + ~pdf2svg~ | 230 \pm 2 ms | 16 KiB              |

So, let's use ~dvipng~ for previewing LaTeX fragments in-Emacs, but ~dvisvgm~ for [[LaTeX Rendering]].

Unfortunately, it seems that SVG sizing is annoying ATM, so let's actually not do this right now.

*** Exporting
**** General settings
By default Org only exports the first three levels of headings as ... headings.
This is rather unfortunate as my documents frequently stray far beyond three
levels of depth. The two main formats I care about exporting to are LaTeX and
HTML. When using an =article= class, LaTeX headlines go from =\section=,
=\subsection=, =\subsubsection=, and =\paragraph= to =\subgraph= --- /five/ levels.
HTML5 has six levels of headings (=<h1>= to =<h6>=), but first level Org headings
get exported as =<h2>= elements --- leaving /five/ usable levels.

As such, it would seem to make sense to recognise the first /five/ levels of Org
headings when exporting.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-headline-levels 5) ; I like nesting
#+end_src

I'm also going to make use of an item in =ox-extra= so that I can add an =:ignore:=
tag to headings for the content to be kept, but the heading itself ignored
(unlike =:noexport:= which ignored both heading and content). This is useful when
I want to use headings to provide a structure for writing that doesn't appear in
the final documents.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-extra)
(ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines))
#+end_src

Since I (roughly) track Org ~HEAD~, it makes sense to include the git version in
the creator string.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-creator-string
      (format "Emacs %s (Org mode %s–%s)" emacs-version (org-release) (org-git-version)))
#+end_src

**** Acronym formatting
I like automatically using spaced small caps for acronyms. For strings I want to
be unaffected let's use ~;~ as a prefix to prevent the transformation --- i.e.
~;JFK~ (as one would want for two-letter geographic locations and names).

This has to be implemented on a per-format basis, currently HTML and LaTeX
exports are supported.

Since this collapsability seems useful to have on by default for certain chunks
of code, it would be nice if you could set it with =#+attr_html: :collapsed t=.

It would be nice to also have a corresponding global / session-local way of
setting this, but I haven't quite been able to get that working (yet).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-html-export-collapsed nil)
(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:collapsed "COLLAPSED" "collapsed" org-html-export-collapsed t)

(add-to-list 'org-default-properties "EXPORT_COLLAPSED")
#+end_src

We can take our src block modification a step further, and add a gutter on the
side of the src block containing both an anchor referencing the current block,
and a button to copy the content of the block.

**** Include extra font-locking in htmlize

Org uses [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize.el]] to export buffers with syntax highlighting.

The works fantastically, for the most part. Minor modes that provide
font-locking are /not/ loaded, and so do not impact the result.

By enabling these modes in ~htmlize-before-hook~ we can correct this behaviour.

**** Handle table overflow
In order to accommodate wide tables ---particularly on mobile devices--- we want
to set a maximum width and scroll overflow. Unfortunately, this cannot be applied
directly to the ~table~ element, so we have to wrap it in a ~div~.

While we're at it, we can a link gutter, as we did with src blocks, and show the
~#+name~, if one is given.

**** TOC as a collapsable tree
The TOC is much nicer to navigate as a collapsable tree. Unfortunately we cannot
achieve this with CSS alone. Thankfully we can avoid JS though, by adapting the
TOC generation code to use a ~label~ for each item, and a hidden ~checkbox~ to keep
track of state.

To add this, we need to change one line in [[file:~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/org-mode/lisp/ox-html.el::(format "<a href=\"#%s\">%s</a>"][org-html--format-toc-headline]].

Since we can actually accomplish the desired effect by adding advice /around/ the
function, without overriding it --- let's do that to reduce the bug surface of
this config a tad.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable (orig-fn headline info)
  "Add a label and checkbox to `org-html--format-toc-headline's usual output,
to allow the TOC to be a collapseable tree."
  :around #'org-html--format-toc-headline
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn headline info)
    (let ((id (or (org-element-property :CUSTOM_ID headline)
                  (org-export-get-reference headline info))))
      (format "<input type='checkbox' id='toc--%s'/><label for='toc--%s'>%s</label>"
              id id (funcall orig-fn headline info)))))
#+end_src

Now, leaves (headings with no children) shouldn't have the ~label~ item. The
obvious way to achieve this is by including some /if no children.../ logic in
~org-html--format-toc-headline-colapseable~. Unfortunately, I can't my elisp isn't
up to par to extract the number of child headings from the mountain of info that
org provides.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-html--toc-text-stripped-leaves (orig-fn toc-entries)
  "Remove label"
  :around #'org-html--toc-text
  (if (or (not org-fancy-html-export-mode) (bound-and-true-p org-msg-export-in-progress))
      (funcall orig-fn toc-entries)
    (replace-regexp-in-string "<input [^>]+><label [^>]+>\\(.+?\\)</label></li>" "\\1</li>"
                              (funcall orig-fn toc-entries))))
#+end_src
**** Make verbatim different to code
Since we have =verbatim= and ~code~, let's make use of the difference.

We can use ~code~ exclusively for code snippets and commands like: "calling
src_elisp{(message "Hello")} in batch-mode Emacs prints to stdout like ~echo~".
Then we can use =verbatim= for miscellaneous 'other monospace' like keyboard
shortcuts: "either =C-c C-c= or =C-g= is likely the most useful keybinding in Emacs",
or file names: "I keep my configuration in =~/.config/doom/=", among other things.

Then, styling these two cases differently can help improve clarity in a document.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-text-markup-alist
      '((bold . "<b>%s</b>")
        (code . "<code>%s</code>")
        (italic . "<i>%s</i>")
        (strike-through . "<del>%s</del>")
        (underline . "<span class=\"underline\">%s</span>")
        (verbatim . "<kbd>%s</kbd>")))
#+end_src
**** Change checkbox type
We also want to use HTML checkboxes, however we want to get a bit fancier than default
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(appendq! org-html-checkbox-types
          '((html-span
             (on . "<span class='checkbox'></span>")
             (off . "<span class='checkbox'></span>")
             (trans . "<span class='checkbox'></span>"))))
(setq org-html-checkbox-type 'html-span)
#+end_src

**** Extra special strings
The ~org-html-special-string-regexps~ variable defines substitutions for:
+ =\-=, a shy hyphen
+ =---=, an em dash
+ =--=, an en dash
+ =...=, (horizontal) ellipses

However I think it would be nice if there was also a substitution for left/right
arrows (=->= and =<-=). This is a ~defconst~, but as you may tell from the amount of
advice in this config, I'm not above messing with things I'm not 'supposed' to.

The only minor complication is that =<= and =>= are converted to =&lt;= and =&gt;=
before this stage of output processing.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(pushnew! org-html-special-string-regexps
          '("-&gt;" . "&#8594;")
          '("&lt;-" . "&#8592;"))

**** Header anchors
I want to add GitHub-style links on hover for headings.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-export-html-headline-anchor (text backend info)
  (when (and (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
             (not (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 're-reveal))

      (replace-regexp-in-string
       "<h\\([0-9]\\) id=\"\\([a-z0-9-]+\\)\">\\(.*[^ ]\\)<\\/h[0-9]>" ; this is quite restrictive, but due to `org-reference-contraction' I can do this
       "<h\\1 id=\"\\2\">\\3<a aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#\\2\">#</a> </h\\1>"
       text))))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-headline-functions
             'org-export-html-headline-anchor)
#+end_src
**** Link previews
Sometimes it's nice to make a link particularly prominent, an embed/preview like
Twitter does would be nice I think.

We can do this without too much trouble by adding a new link type ever so
slightly different from =https= --- =Https=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-link-set-parameters "Https"
                         :follow (lambda (url arg) (browse-url (concat "https:" url) arg))
                         :export #'org-url-fancy-export)
#+end_src

Then, if we can fetch a plist of the form src_elisp{(:title "..." :description
"..." :image "...")} for such links via a function ~org-url-unfurl-metadata~, we
can make a fancy export.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-url-fancy-export (url _desc backend)
  (let ((metadata (org-url-unfurl-metadata (concat "https:" url))))
    (cond
     ((org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'html)
      (concat
       "<div class=\"link-preview\">"
       (format "<a href=\"%s\">" (concat "https:" url))
       (when (plist-get metadata :image)
         (format "<img src=\"%s\"/>" (plist-get metadata :image)))
       "<small>"
       (replace-regexp-in-string "//\\(?:www\\.\\)?\\([^/]+\\)/?.*" "\\1" url)
       "</small><p>"
       (when (plist-get metadata :title)
         (concat "<b>" (org-html-encode-plain-text (plist-get metadata :title)) "</b></br>"))
       (when (plist-get metadata :description)
         (org-html-encode-plain-text (plist-get metadata :description)))
       "</p></a></div>"))
     (t url))))
#+end_src

Now we just need to actually implement that metadata extraction function.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-url-unfurl-metadata--cache nil)
(defun org-url-unfurl-metadata (url)
  (cdr (or (assoc url org-url-unfurl-metadata--cache)
           (car (push
                 (cons

                                                                (url-retrieve-synchronously url t t 5))
                                      (goto-char (point-min))
                                      (delete-region (point-min) (- (search-forward "<head") 6))

**** LaTeX Rendering
***** Pre-rendered
I consider ~dvisvgm~ to be a rather compelling option. However this isn't scaled
very well at the moment.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; (setq-default org-html-with-latex `dvisvgm)
#+end_src

***** MathJax
If MathJax is used, we want to use version 3 instead of the default version 2.
Looking at a [[https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php][comparison]] we seem to find that it is ~5 times as fast, uses a
single file instead of multiple, but seems to be a bit bigger unfortunately.
Thankfully this can be mitigated my adding the ~async~ attribute to defer loading.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-html-mathjax-options
      '((path "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-svg.js" )
        (scale "1")
        (autonumber "ams")
        (multlinewidth "85%")
        (tagindent ".8em")
        (tagside "right")))

(setq org-html-mathjax-template
      "<script>
MathJax = {
  chtml: {
    scale: %SCALE
  },
  svg: {
    scale: %SCALE,
    fontCache: \"global\"
  },
  tex: {
    tags: \"%AUTONUMBER\",
    multlineWidth: \"%MULTLINEWIDTH\",
    tagSide: \"%TAGSIDE\",
    tagIndent: \"%TAGINDENT\"
  }
};
</script>
<script id=\"MathJax-script\" async
        src=\"%PATH\"></script>")
#+end_src
*** LaTeX Export
**** Compiling
By default Org uses ~pdflatex~ \times 3 + ~bibtex~. This simply won't do in our
modern world. ~latexmk~ + ~biber~ (which is used automatically with ~latexmk~) is a
simply superior combination.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; org-latex-compilers = ("pdflatex" "xelatex" "lualatex"), which are the possible values for %latex
(setq org-latex-pdf-process '("LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 latexmk -f -pdf -%latex -shell-escape -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=%o %f"))
#+end_src

While ~org-latex-pdf-process~ does support a function, and we could use that
instead, this would no longer use the log buffer --- it's a bit blind, you give
it the file name and expect it to do its thing.

The default values of ~org-latex-compilers~ is given in commented form to see how
~org-latex-pdf-process~ works with them.

While the ~-%latex~ above is slightly hacky (~-pdflatex~ expects to be given a
value) it allows us to leave ~org-latex-compilers~ unmodified.
This is nice in case I open an org file that uses =#+LATEX_COMPILER= for example,
it should still work.

**** Nicer checkboxes

We'll assume that thanks to the clever preamble the various custom =\checkbox...=
commands below are defined.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-export-latex-fancy-item-checkboxes (text backend info)
  (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
    (replace-regexp-in-string
     "\\\\item\\[{$\\\\\\(\\w+\\)$}\\]"
     (lambda (fullmatch)
       (concat "\\\\item[" (pcase (substring fullmatch 9 -3) ; content of capture group
                             ("square"   "\\\\checkboxUnchecked")
                             ("boxminus" "\\\\checkboxTransitive")
                             ("boxtimes" "\\\\checkboxChecked")
                             (_ (substring fullmatch 9 -3))) "]"))
     text)))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-item-functions
             '+org-export-latex-fancy-item-checkboxes)
#+end_src

**** Class templates

I really like the KOMA bundle. It provides a set of mechanisms to tweak document
styling which is both easy to use, and quite comprehensive.
For example, I rather like section numbers in the margin, which can be
accomplished with
#+name: latex-hanging-secnum
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\renewcommand\\sectionformat{\\llap{\\thesection\\autodot\\enskip}}
\\renewcommand\\subsectionformat{\\llap{\\thesubsection\\autodot\\enskip}}
\\renewcommand\\subsubsectionformat{\\llap{\\thesubsubsection\\autodot\\enskip}}
#+end_src

It can also be nice to have big =\chapter=​s.
#+name: latex-big-chapter
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\RedeclareSectionCommand[afterindent=false, beforeskip=0pt, afterskip=0pt, innerskip=0pt]{chapter}
\\setkomafont{chapter}{\\normalfont\\Huge}
\\renewcommand*{\\chapterheadstartvskip}{\\vspace*{0\\baselineskip}}
\\renewcommand*{\\chapterheadendvskip}{\\vspace*{0\\baselineskip}}
\\renewcommand*{\\chapterformat}{%
  \\fontsize{60}{30}\\selectfont\\rlap{\\hspace{6pt}\\thechapter}}
\\renewcommand*\\chapterlinesformat[3]{%
  \\parbox[b]{\\dimexpr\\textwidth-0.5em\\relax}{%
    \\raggedleft{{\\large\\scshape\\bfseries\\chapapp}\\vspace{-0.5ex}\\par\\Huge#3}}%
    \\hfill\\makebox[0pt][l]{#2}}
#+end_src

Now let's just sprinkle some KOMA all over the Org LaTeX classes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(after! ox-latex
  (let* ((article-sections '(("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")

         (book-sections (append '(("\\chapter{%s}" . "\\chapter*{%s}"))
                                article-sections))
         (hanging-secnum-preamble "

         (big-chap-preamble "

    (setcdr (assoc "article" org-latex-classes)

    (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
                 `("book" ,(concat "\\documentclass[twoside=false]{scrbook}"
                                   big-chap-preamble hanging-secnum-preamble)

    (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
                 `("bmc" "\\documentclass[code,maths]{bmc}\n[NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]\n[NO-PACKAGES]\n[EXTRA]"
                   ,@book-sections))))

(setq org-latex-tables-booktabs t
      org-latex-hyperref-template "
<<latex-fancy-hyperref>>

      org-latex-reference-command "\\cref{%s}")
#+end_src


The =hyperref= setup needs to be handled separately however.
#+name: latex-fancy-hyperref
#+begin_src LaTeX

  citecolor=cite\n}
\\urlstyle{same}
#+end_src

**** A cleverer preamble
***** Use case
We often want particular snippets of LaTeX in our documents preambles.
It's a pain to have to work out / remember them every time.
For example, I almost always want to include the snippet below.

#+name: org-latex-embed-files-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage[main,include]{embedall}
\\IfFileExists{./\\jobname.org}{\\embedfile[desc=The original file]{\\jobname.org}}{}
#+end_src

We could have every package we could possibly need in every one of
~org-latex-classes~, but that's /horribly/ inefficient and I don't want to think
about maintaining that.

Instead we can provide some granularity by splitting up the features we want,
and then take the experience to a whole new level by implementing a system to
automatically detect which features are desired and generating a preamble that
provides these features.

***** Conditional Content

Let's consider content we want in particular situations.

Captions could do with a bit of tweaking such that
+ You can easily have multiple captions
+ Links to figures take you to the /top/ of the figure (not the bottom)
+ Caption labels could do with being emphasised slightly more
+ Multiline captions should run ragged-right, but only when then span more than
  one line

#+name: org-latex-caption-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage{subcaption}
\\usepackage[hypcap=true]{caption}
\\setkomafont{caption}{\\sffamily\\small}
\\setkomafont{captionlabel}{\\upshape\\bfseries}
\\captionsetup{justification=raggedright,singlelinecheck=true}
\\usepackage{capt-of} % required by Org
#+end_src

The default checkboxes look rather ugly, so let's provide some prettier alternatives.

#+name: org-latex-checkbox-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\newcommand{\\checkboxUnchecked}{$\\square$}
\\newcommand{\\checkboxTransitive}{\\rlap{\\raisebox{-0.1ex}{\\hspace{0.35ex}\\Large\\textbf -}}$\\square$}
\\newcommand{\\checkboxChecked}{\\rlap{\\raisebox{0.2ex}{\\hspace{0.35ex}\\scriptsize \\ding{52}}}$\\square$}
#+end_src

It's nice to have "message blocks", things like info/warning/error/success.
A LaTeX macro should make them trivial to create.

#+name: org-latex-box-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\ExplSyntaxOn
\\NewCoffin\\Content
\\NewCoffin\\SideRule
\\NewDocumentCommand{\\defsimplebox}{O{\\ding{117}} O{0.36em} m m m}{%
  % #1 ding, #2 ding offset, #3 name, #4 colour, #5 default label
  \\definecolor{#3}{HTML}{#4}
  \\NewDocumentEnvironment{#3}{ O{#5} }
  {
    \\vcoffin_set:Nnw \\Content { \\linewidth }
    \\noindent \\ignorespaces
    \\par\\vspace{-0.7\\baselineskip}%
    \\textcolor{#3}{#1}~\\textcolor{#3}{\\textbf{##1}}%
    \\vspace{-0.8\\baselineskip}
    \\begin{addmargin}[1em]{1em}
    }
    {
    \\end{addmargin}
    \\vspace{-0.5\\baselineskip}
    \\vcoffin_set_end:
    \\SetHorizontalCoffin\\SideRule{\\color{#3}\\rule{1pt}{\\CoffinTotalHeight\\Content}}
    \\JoinCoffins*\\Content[l,t]\\SideRule[l,t](#2,-0.7em)
    \\noindent\\TypesetCoffin\\Content
    \\vspace*{\\CoffinTotalHeight\\Content}\\bigskip
    \\vspace{-2\\baselineskip}
  }
}
\\ExplSyntaxOff
#+end_src

Lastly, we will pass this content into some global variables we for ease of
access.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(defvar org-latex-embed-files-preamble "
<<org-latex-embed-files-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that embeds files within the pdf.")

(defvar org-latex-caption-preamble "
<<org-latex-caption-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that improves captions.")

(defvar org-latex-checkbox-preamble "
<<org-latex-checkbox-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that improves checkboxes.")

(defvar org-latex-box-preamble "
<<org-latex-box-preamble>>
"
  "Preamble that provides a macro for custom boxes.")
#+end_src

In the "universal preamble", we already embed the source =.org= file, but it would
be nice to embed all the tangled files. This is fairly easy to accomplish by
mapping each tangled file to a form which embeds the file if it exists.
Considering we're going this far, why not add a dedicated =#+emded= keyword, so we
can embed whatever we want.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-embed-extra-files ()
  "Return a string that uses embedfile to embed all tangled files."
  (mapconcat
   (lambda (file-desc)
     (format "\\IfFileExists{%1$s}{\\embedfile[desc=%2$s]{%1$s}}{}"
             (thread-last (car file-desc)
               (replace-regexp-in-string "\\\\" "\\\\\\\\")
               (replace-regexp-in-string "~" "\\\\string~"))
             (cdr file-desc)))
   (append
    (mapcar (lambda (f-block)
              (let ((file-lang (cons (or (car f-block) (caddr (cadr f-block))) (caadr f-block))))
                (cons (car file-lang) (format "Tangled %s file" (cdr file-lang)))))
            (org-babel-tangle-collect-blocks)) ; all files being tangled to
    (let (extra-files)
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (while (re-search-forward "^[ \t]*#\\+embed:" nil t)
          (let* ((file-desc (split-string (org-element-property :value (org-element-at-point)) " :desc\\(?:ription\\)? ")))
            (push (cons (car file-desc) (or (cdr file-desc) "Extra file")) extra-files))))
      (nreverse extra-files)))
   "\n"))
#+end_src

Now all tangled files will be embedded, and we can embed arbitrary files like
so:
#+begin_src org
,#+embed: some-file :description flavour text about the file
#+end_src

This currently won't complete or anything like that, as we haven't told Org that
it's a keyword yet. It's also LaTeX-specific, so maybe it should be changed to
=#+latex_embed= or something like that.

***** Content-feature-preamble association

Initially this idea was implemented with an alist that associated a construct
that would search the current Org file for an indication that some feature was
needed, with a LaTeX snippet to be inserted in the preamble which would provide
that feature.
This is all well and good when there is a bijection between detected features
and the LaTeX code needed to support those features, but in many cases this
relation is not injective.

To better model the reality of the situation, I add an extra layer to this
process where each detected feature gives a list of required "feature flags".
Simply be merging the lists of feature flags we no longer have to require
injectivity to avoid LaTeX duplication. Then the extra layer forms a bijection
between there feature flags and a specification which can be used to implement
the feature.

This model also provides a number of nice secondary benefits, such as a simple
implementation of feature dependency.

First we will implement the feature detection component of this model. I'd like
this to be able to use as much state information as possible, so the feature
tests should be very versatile.

  "Org feature tests and associated LaTeX feature flags.

Alist where the car is a test for the presense of the feature,
and the cdr is either a single feature symbol or list of feature symbols.

When a string, it is used as a regex search in the buffer.
The feature is registered as present when there is a match.

The car can also be a
- symbol, the value of which is fetched
- function, which is called with info as an argument
- list, which is `eval'uated

If the symbol, function, or list produces a string: that is used as a regex
search in the buffer. Otherwise any non-nil return value will indicate the
existance of the feature.")
#+end_src

Then we provide a way to generate the preamble that provides those features.
In addition to the features named in ~org-latex-conditional-features~ we'll also
create /meta-features/, which can be required by other features (with =:requires=),
or be active by default (=:eager t=). For further control I some features may only
be used when certain other features are active (with =:when=), and masked by other
features (with =:prevents=). I will use the convention of starting meta-features
with =.=, and =:eager= features with =!= to make their nature more readily apparent.

Another consideration in LaTeX is load order, which matters in some cases.
Beyond that, it's nice to have some sort of sensible ordering. For this I'll
introduce an =:order= keyword. Using this I'll arrange snippets as follows.

+ =-2= Embed files setup
+ =-1= Extra file embedding
+ =0= Typography
  - =0= Fonts themselves
  - =0.1= Typographic tweaks (=microtype=)
  - =0.2= Maths setup
  - =0.3= Maths font
  - =0.4= Extra text shaping (~\acr~)
  - =0.5-0.9= Miscellaneous text modifications, trying to put shorter snippets first
+ =1= (/default/)
+ =2= Tables and figures
+ =3= Miscellaneous short content
+ =4= Fancy boxes

***** Feature determination

Now that we have ~org-latex-conditional-features~ defined, we need to use it to
extract a list of features found in an Org buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-detect-features (&optional buffer info)

#+end_src

***** Preamble generation

Once a list of required features has been determined, we want to use
~org-latex-feature-implementations~ to generate the LaTeX which should be inserted
into the preamble to provide those features.

First we want to process our fancy keywords in ~org-latex-feature-implementations~
to produce an /expanded/ list of features. We'll do that by performing the
following steps.
+ The dependencies for each listed feature are added to feature list
  (src_elisp{:requires}).
+ The src_elisp{:when} conditions of each feature, and available features with
  src_elisp{:eager t}, are evaluated, and added/removed accordingly
+ Any features present in a src_elisp{:prevents} value are removed
+ The feature list is scrubbed of duplicates
+ The feature list is sorted by src_elisp{:order} (ascending)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-expand-features (features)
  "For each feature in FEATURES process :requires, :when, and :prevents keywords and sort according to :order."
  (dolist (feature features)
    (unless (assoc feature org-latex-feature-implementations)
      (message "Feature %s not provided in org-latex-feature-implementations, ignoring." feature)
      (setq features (remove feature features))))
  (setq current features)
  (while current
    (when-let ((requirements (plist-get (cdr (assq (car current) org-latex-feature-implementations)) :requires)))
      (setcdr current (if (listp requirements)
                          (append requirements (cdr current))
                        (cons requirements (cdr current)))))
    (setq current (cdr current)))
  (dolist (potential-feature
           (append features (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (feat)
                                                (when (plist-get (cdr feat) :eager)
                                                  (car feat)))
                                              org-latex-feature-implementations))))
    (when-let ((prerequisites (plist-get (cdr (assoc potential-feature org-latex-feature-implementations)) :when)))
      (setf features (if (if (listp prerequisites)
                             (cl-every (lambda (preq) (memq preq features)) prerequisites)
                           (memq prerequisites features))
                         (append (list potential-feature) features)
                       (delq potential-feature features)))))
  (dolist (feature features)
    (when-let ((prevents (plist-get (cdr (assoc feature org-latex-feature-implementations)) :prevents)))
      (setf features (cl-set-difference features (if (listp prevents) prevents (list prevents))))))
  (sort (delete-dups features)
        (lambda (feat1 feat2)
          (if (< (or (plist-get (cdr (assoc feat1 org-latex-feature-implementations)) :order) 1)
                 (or (plist-get (cdr (assoc feat2 org-latex-feature-implementations)) :order) 1))
              t nil))))
#+end_src

Now that we have a nice list of the final features to use, we can just pull out
their snippets and join the result together.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-generate-features-preamble (features)
  "Generate the LaTeX preamble content required to provide FEATURES.
This is done according to `org-latex-feature-implementations'"
  (let ((expanded-features (org-latex-expand-features features)))
    (concat
     (format "\n%% features: %s\n" expanded-features)
     (mapconcat (lambda (feature)
                  (when-let ((snippet (plist-get (cdr (assoc feature org-latex-feature-implementations)) :snippet)))
                    (concat
                     (pcase snippet
                       ((pred stringp) snippet)
                       ((pred functionp) (funcall snippet features))
                       ((pred listp) (eval `(let ((features ',features)) (,@snippet))))
                       ((pred symbolp) (symbol-value snippet))
                       (_ (user-error "org-latex-feature-implementations :snippet value %s unable to be used" snippet)))
                     "\n")))
                expanded-features
                "")
     "% end features\n")))
#+end_src

Then Org needs to be advised to actually use this generated preamble content.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar info--tmp nil)

(defadvice! org-latex-save-info (info &optional t_ s_)
  :before #'org-latex-make-preamble
  (setq info--tmp info))

(defadvice! org-splice-latex-header-and-generated-preamble-a (orig-fn tpl def-pkg pkg snippets-p &optional extra)
  "Dynamically insert preamble content based on `org-latex-conditional-preambles'."
  :around #'org-splice-latex-header
  (let ((header (funcall orig-fn tpl def-pkg pkg snippets-p extra)))
    (if snippets-p header
      (concat header
              (org-latex-generate-features-preamble (org-latex-detect-features nil info--tmp))
              "\n"))))
#+end_src

My use of ~info--tmp~ is somewhat hacky. When I try to upstream this, this should
become much cleaner as I can pass info through by directly modifying
~org-latex-make-preamble~.

***** Reduce default packages

Thanks to our additions, we can remove a few packages from
~org-latex-default-packages-alist~.

There are also some obsolete entries in the default value, specifically
+ =grffile='s capabilities are built into the current version of =graphicx=
+ =textcomp='s functionality has been included in LaTeX's core for a while now

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-default-packages-alist
      '(("AUTO" "inputenc" t ("pdflatex"))
        ("T1" "fontenc" t ("pdflatex"))
        ("" "xcolor" nil) ; Generally useful
        ("" "hyperref" nil)))
#+end_src
**** Font collections

Using the lovely conditional preamble, I'll define a number of font collections
that can be used for LaTeX exports. Who knows, maybe I'll use it with other
export formats too at some point.

To start with I'll create a default state variable and register =fontset= as part
of =#+options=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-default-fontset 'alegreya
  "Fontset from `org-latex-fontsets' to use by default.
As cm (computer modern) is TeX's default, that causes nothing
to be added to the document.

If \"nil\" no custom fonts will ever be used.")

(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:latex-font-set nil "fontset" org-latex-default-fontset)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex))))
#+end_src

Then a function is needed to generate a LaTeX snippet which applies the fontset. It
would be nice if this could be done for individual styles and use different
styles as the main document font. If the individual typefaces for a fontset are
defined individually as
src_elisp{:serif}, src_elisp{:sans}, src_elisp{:mono}, and src_elisp{:maths}.
I can use those to generate LaTeX for subsets of the full fontset. Then, if I
don't let any fontset names have =-= in them, I can use =-sans= and =-mono= as
suffixes that specify the document font to use.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-fontset-entry ()
  "Get the fontset spec of the current file.
Has format \"name\" or \"name-style\" where 'name' is one of
the cars in `org-latex-fontsets'."
  (let ((fontset-spec
         (symbol-name
          (or (car (delq nil
                         (mapcar
                          (lambda (opt-line)
                            (plist-get (org-export--parse-option-keyword opt-line 'latex)
                                       :latex-font-set))
                          (cdar (org-collect-keywords '("OPTIONS"))))))
              org-latex-default-fontset))))
    (cons (intern (car (split-string fontset-spec "-")))
          (when (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))
            (intern (concat ":" (cadr (split-string fontset-spec "-"))))))))

(defun org-latex-fontset (&rest desired-styles)
  "Generate a LaTeX preamble snippet which applies the current fontset for DESIRED-STYLES."
  (let* ((fontset-spec (org-latex-fontset-entry))
         (fontset (alist-get (car fontset-spec) org-latex-fontsets)))
    (if fontset
        (concat
         (mapconcat
          (lambda (style)
            (when (plist-get fontset style)
              (concat (plist-get fontset style) "\n")))
          desired-styles
          "")
         (when (memq (cdr fontset-spec) desired-styles)
           (pcase (cdr fontset-spec)
             (:serif "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\rmdefault}\n")
             (:sans "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\sfdefault}\n")
             (:mono "\\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{\\ttdefault}\n"))))
      (error "Font-set %s is not provided in org-latex-fontsets" (car fontset-spec)))))
#+end_src

Now that all the functionality has been implemented, we should hook it into our
preamble generation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '(org-latex-default-fontset . custom-font) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(custom-font :snippet (org-latex-fontset :serif :sans :mono) :order 0) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(.custom-maths-font :eager t :when (custom-font maths) :snippet (org-latex-fontset :maths) :order 0.3) t)
#+end_src

Finally, we just need to add some fonts.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar org-latex-fontsets
  '((cm nil) ; computer modern
    (## nil) ; no font set
    (alegreya

#+end_src

When we're using Alegreya we can apply a lovely little tweak to =tabular= which
(locally) changes the figures used to lining fixed-width.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '((string= (car (org-latex-fontset-entry)) "alegreya") . alegreya-typeface))
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(alegreya-typeface) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations'(.alegreya-tabular-figures :eager t :when (alegreya-typeface table) :order 0.5 :snippet "
\\makeatletter
% tabular lining figures in tables

\\makeatother\n") t)
#+end_src

Due to the Alegreya's metrics, the =\LaTeX= symbol doesn't quite look right. We
can correct for this by redefining it with subtlety shifted kerning.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '("LaTeX" . latex-symbol))
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(latex-symbol :when alegreya-typeface :order 0.5 :snippet "

**** Cover page

To make a nice cover page, a simple method that comes to mind is just redefining
=\maketitle=. To get precise control over the positioning we'll use the =tikz=
package, and then add in the Tikz libraries =calc= and =shapes.geometric= to make
some nice decorations for the background.

I'll start off by setting up the required additions to the preamble.
This will accomplish the following:
+ Load the required packages
+ Redefine =\maketitle=
+ Draw an Org icon with Tikz to use in the cover page (it's a little easter egg)
+ Start a new page after the table of contents by redefining =\tableofcontents=

Now we've got a nice cover page to work with, we just need to use it every now
and then. Adding this to =#+options= feels most appropriate.
Let's have the =coverpage= option accept =auto= as a value and then decide whether
or not a cover page should be used based on the word count --- I'll have this be
the global default. Then we just want to insert a LaTeX snippet tweak the
subtitle format to use the cover page.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(defvar org-latex-cover-page 'auto
  "When t, use a cover page by default.
When auto, use a cover page when the document's wordcount exceeds
`org-latex-cover-page-wordcount-threshold'.

Set with #+option: coverpage:{yes,auto,no} in org buffers.")
(defvar org-latex-cover-page-wordcount-threshold 5000
  "Document word count at which a cover page will be used automatically.
This condition is applied when cover page option is set to auto.")
(defvar org-latex-subtitle-coverpage-format "\\\\\\bigskip\n\\LARGE\\mdseries\\itshape\\color{black!80} %s\\par"
  "Variant of `org-latex-subtitle-format' to use with the cover page.")
(defvar org-latex-cover-page-maketitle "
<<latex-cover-page>>
"
  "LaTeX snippet for the preamble that sets \\maketitle to produce a cover page.")

(eval '(cl-pushnew '(:latex-cover-page nil "coverpage" org-latex-cover-page)
                   (org-export-backend-options (org-export-get-backend 'latex))))

(defun org-latex-cover-page-p ()
  "Whether a cover page should be used when exporting this Org file."
  (pcase (or (car
              (delq nil
                    (mapcar
                     (lambda (opt-line)
                       (plist-get (org-export--parse-option-keyword opt-line 'latex) :latex-cover-page))
                     (cdar (org-collect-keywords '("OPTIONS"))))))
             org-latex-cover-page)
    ((or 't 'yes) t)

    (_ nil)))

**** Condensed lists
LaTeX is generally pretty good by default, but it's /really/ generous with how
much space it puts between list items by default. I'm generally not a fan.

Thankfully this is easy to correct with a small snippet:
#+name: latex-condense-lists
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\newcommand{\\setuplistspacing}{\\setlength{\\itemsep}{-0.5ex}\\setlength{\\parskip}{1.5ex}\\setlength{\\parsep}{0pt}}
\\let\\olditem\\itemize\\renewcommand{\\itemize}{\\olditem\\setuplistspacing}
\\let\\oldenum\\enumerate\\renewcommand{\\enumerate}{\\oldenum\\setuplistspacing}
\\let\\olddesc\\description\\renewcommand{\\description}{\\olddesc\\setuplistspacing}
#+end_src

Then we can just hook this in with our clever preamble.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(defvar org-latex-condense-lists t
  "Reduce the space between list items.")
(defvar org-latex-condensed-lists "
<<latex-condense-lists>>
")

(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '((and org-latex-condense-lists "^[ \t]*[-+]\\|^[ \t]*[1Aa][.)] ") . condensed-lists) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(condensed-lists :snippet org-latex-condensed-lists :order 0.7) t)
#+end_src

**** Pretty code blocks

We could just use minted for syntax highlighting --- however, we can do better!
The =engrave-faces= package lets us use Emacs' font-lock for syntax highlighting,
exporting that as LaTeX commands.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! engrave-faces :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/engrave-faces"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle yes
(use-package! engrave-faces-latex
  :after ox-latex)
#+end_src

We'll modify the way listings are generated to make using this as easy as:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-latex-listings 'engraved) ; NOTE non-standard value
#+end_src

Thanks to ~org-latex-conditional-features~ and some copy-paste with the =minted=
entry in ~org-latex-scr-block~ we can easily add this as a recognised
~org-latex-listings~ value.

#+end_src

Whenever this is used, in order for it to actually work (and look a little
better) we add bit to the preamble:

#+name: org-latex-engraved-code-preamble
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage{fvextra}
\\fvset{

  highlightcolor=white!95!black!80!blue,

\\definecolor{codebackground}{HTML}{f7f7f7}
\\definecolor{codeborder}{HTML}{f0f0f0}

% TODO have code boxes keep line vertical alignment

  {boxsep=2.5pt, arc=0pt, outer arc=0pt,
    boxrule=0pt, leftrule=1.5pt, left=0.5pt},
  right=2pt, top=1pt, bottom=0.5pt,
  breakable}
#+end_src

One little annoyance with this is the interaction between microtype and =Verbatim=
environments. Protrusion is not desirable here. Thankfully, we can patch the
=Verbatim= environment to turn off protrusion locally.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations
             '(.no-protrusion-in-code :snippet "\\let\\oldcode\\Code\\renewcommand{\\Code}{\\microtypesetup{protrusion=false}\\oldcode}"
                                      :when (microtype engraved-code-setup)
                                      :eager t
                                      :order 98.5) t)
#+end_src

At some point it would be nice to make the box colours easily customisable. At
the moment it's fairly easy to change the syntax highlighting colours with
src_elisp{(setq engrave-faces-preset-styles (engrave-faces-generate-preset))},
but perhaps a toggle which specifies whether to use the default values, the
current theme, or any named theme could be a good idea. It should also possible
to set the box background dynamically to match. The named theme could work by
looking for a style definition with a certain name in a cache dir, and then
switching to that theme and producing (and saving) the style definition if it
doesn't exist.

Now let's have the example block be styled similarly.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-latex-example-block-engraved (orig-fn example-block contents info)
  "Like `org-latex-example-block', but supporting an engraved backend"
  :around #'org-latex-example-block
  (let ((output-block (funcall orig-fn example-block contents info)))
    (if (eq 'engraved (plist-get info :latex-listings))
        (format "\\begin{Code}[alt]\n%s\n\\end{Code}" output-block)
      output-block)))
#+end_src

In addition to the vastly superior visual output, this should also be much
faster to compile for code-heavy documents (like this config).

Performing a little benchmark with this document, I find that this is indeed the
case.

| LaTeX syntax highlighting backend | Compile time | Overhead | Overhead ratio |
|-----------------------------------+--------------+----------+----------------|
| verbatim                          | 12 s         | 0        |            0.0 |
| lstlistings                       | 15 s         | 3 s      |            0.2 |
| Engrave                           | 34 s         | 22 s     |            1.8 |
| Pygments (Minted)                 | 184 s        | 172 s    |           14.3 |
#+TBLFM: $3=$2-@2$2::$4=$3 / @2$2;%.1f

Treating the verbatim (no syntax highlighting) result as a baseline; this
rudimentary test suggest that =engrave-faces= is around eight times faster than
=pygments=, and takes three times as long as no syntax highlighting (verbatim).

**** Julia code blocks

Julia code has fantastic support for unicode! The downside is that =pdflatex= is
/still/ a pain to use with unicode symbols. The solution --- =lualatex=. Now we just
need to make it automatic

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-latex-pick-compiler (_contents info)
  :before #'org-latex-template
  (when (and org-export-has-code-p (memq 'julia-code (org-latex-detect-features)))
    (setf info (plist-put
                (if (member #'+org-latex-replace-non-ascii-chars (plist-get info :filter-final-output))
                    (plist-put info :filter-final-output
                               (delq #'+org-latex-replace-non-ascii-chars (plist-get info :filter-final-output)))
                  info)
                :latex-compiler "lualatex"))))
#+end_src

Then a font with unicode support must be used. JuliaMono is the obvious choice,
and we can use it with the =fontspec= package. In future it may be nice to set
this just as a fallback font (when it isn't a pain to do so).

#+name: julia-mono-fontspec
#+begin_src LaTeX
\\usepackage{fontspec}
\\newfontfamily\\JuliaMono{JuliaMono-Regular.ttf}[Path=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/, Extension=.ttf]
\\newfontface\\JuliaMonoRegular{JuliaMono-Regular}
\\setmonofont{JuliaMonoRegular}[Contextuals=Alternate, Scale=MatchLowercase]
#+end_src

Now all that remains is to hook this into the preamble generation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb no-export
(setq org-latex-julia-mono-fontspec "
<<julia-mono-fontspec>>

**** Emojis
It would be nice to actually include emojis where used.
Thanks to =emojify=, we have a folder of emoji images just sitting and waiting to
be used 🙂.

First up, we want to detect when emojis are actually present. We can try
checking the unicode ranges with a collection of =[?-?]= regex groups, but Emojis
are actually spread around a fair bit and so this isn't very straightforward.
Instead I can iterate thorough non-ASCII characters and check if any have the
text property =emojified=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun emojify-emoji-in-buffer-p ()
  "Determine if any emojis are present in the current buffer, using `emojify-mode'."
  (unless emojify-mode
    (emojify-mode 1)
    (emojify-display-emojis-in-region (point-min) (point-max)))
  (let (emoji-found end)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (not (or emoji-found end))
        (if-let ((pos (re-search-forward "[^[:ascii:]]" nil t)))
            (when (get-text-property (1- pos) 'emojified)
              (setq emoji-found t))
          (setq end t))))
    emoji-found))
#+end_src

Once we know that there are emojis present we can add a bit of preamble to the
buffer to make insertion easier.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-latex-emoji-setup ()
  (format "\\newcommand\\emoji[1]{\\raisebox{-0.3ex}{\\includegraphics[height=1.8ex]{%s/#1}}}" (emojify-image-dir)))

(add-to-list 'org-latex-conditional-features '((emojify-emoji-in-buffer-p) . emoji) t)
(add-to-list 'org-latex-feature-implementations '(emoji :requires image :snippet (org-latex-emoji-setup) :order 3 ))
#+end_src

Once again making use of =emojify=, we can generate LaTeX commands for our emojis
fairly easily.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun emojify-latexify-emoji-in-buffer ()
  (unless emojify-mode
    (emojify-mode 1)
    (emojify-display-emojis-in-region (point-min) (point-max)))
  (let (end)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (while (not end)
        (if-let ((pos (re-search-forward "[^[:ascii:]]\\{1,2\\}" nil t)))
            (when-let ((char (get-text-property (1- pos) 'emojify-text))
                       (emoji (emojify-get-emoji char)))
              (replace-match (format "\\\\emoji{%s}" (file-name-sans-extension (ht-get emoji "image")))))
          (setq end t))))))
#+end_src

Now we just need to hook this handy function into Org's export.
We can't use standard string-replacement as we rely on the buffer modifications
enacted by src_elisp{(emojify-mode)}.

As I have not yet implemented a nice way of sharing feature detection
information outside of src_elisp{(org-latex-generate-features-preamble)}, we'll
use the same check before attempting to LaTeXify emojis and hope that nothing
strange happens.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun +org-latex-convert-emojis (text backend _info)
  (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert text)
      (when (emojify-emoji-in-buffer-p)
        (emojify-latexify-emoji-in-buffer)
        (buffer-string)))))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-final-output-functions #'+org-latex-convert-emojis)
#+end_src

This works fairly nicely, there's just one little QOL upgrade that we can
perform. =emojify= downloads the ~72x72~ versions of Twemoji, however SVG versions
are also produced. We could use ~inkscape~ to convert those to PDFs, which would
likely be best for including.

First, it's worth checking whether =.pdf= graphics files will be prioritised over
=.png= files. If so, that would be ideal as no extra effort is required past
fetching and converting the files.

#+begin_src shell :tangle no :exports both :results output verbatim :wrap example
texdef -t pdflatex -p graphicx Gin@extensions
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
\Gin@extensions:
macro:->.pdf,.png,.jpg,.mps,.jpeg,.jbig2,.jb2,.PDF,.PNG,.JPG,.JPEG,.JBIG2,.JB2,.eps
#+end_example

Fantastic! We can see that =.pdf= actually comes first in the priority list. So
now we just need to fetch and convert those SVGs --- ideally with a handy
command to do so for us.

**** Remove non-ascii chars

When using ~pdflatex~, almost non-ascii characters are generally problematic, and
don't appear in the pdf. It's preferable to see that there was /some/ character
which wasn't displayed as opposed to nothing.

We check every non-ascii character to make sure it's not a character encoded by
the =inputenc= packages when loaded with the =utf8= option. Finally, we see if we
have our own LaTeX conversion we can apply and if there is none we replace the
non-ascii char with =¿=.

No to make sure we only remove characters that can't be displayed, we check
=/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/utf8enc.dfu=.

We just need to make sure this is appended to the list of filter functions,
since we want to let emoji processing occur first.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (let (case-replace)

Now, there are some symbols that aren't included in =inputenc=, but we should be
able to handle anyway. For them we define a table of LaTeX translations

**** Normal spaces after abbreviations

In LaTeX inter-word and sentence spaces are typically of different widths. This
can be an issue when using abbreviations i.e. e.g. etc. et al..
This can be corrected by forcing a normal space with src_LaTeX{\ }.
When exporting Org documents, we can add a filter to check for common
abbreviations and make the space normal.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

**** Extra special strings
LaTeX already recognises =---= and =--= as em/en-dashes, =\-= as a shy hyphen, and the
conversion of =...= to =\ldots{}= is hardcoded into ~org-latex-plain-text~ (unlike
~org-html-plain-text~).

I'd quite like to also recognise =->= and =<-=, so let's set come up with some advice.

**** Support images from URLs
You can link to remote images easily, and they work nicely with HTML-based
exports. However, LaTeX can only include local files, and so the current
behaviour of =org-latex-link= is just to insert a URL to the image.

We can do better than that by downloading the image to a predictable location,
and using that. By making the filename predictable as opposed to just another
tempfile, this can provide a caching mechanism.

**** Make verbatim different to code

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
*** Reveal export

By default reveal is rather nice, there are just a few tweaks that I consider a
good idea.

(setq org-re-reveal-theme "white"
      org-re-reveal-transition "slide"
      org-re-reveal-plugins '(markdown notes math search zoom))
#+end_src
*** ASCII export

To start with, why settle for ASCII when UTF-8 exists?
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-ascii-charset 'utf-8)
#+end_src

The ASCII export is generally fairly nice. I think the main aspect that could
benefit from improvement is the appearance of LaTeX fragments. There's a nice
utility we can use to create unicode representation, which are much nicer.
It's called ~latex2text~, and it's part of the =pylatexenc= package, and it's [[https://repology.org/project/python:pylatexenc/versions][not
really packaged]]. So, we'll resort to installing it with =pip=.

#+begin_src shell :tangle (if (executable-find "latex2text") "no" "setup.sh")
sudo python3 -m pip install pylatexenc
#+end_src

With that installed, we can override the src_elisp{(org-ascii-latex-fragment)} and
src_elisp{(org-ascii-latex-environment)} functions, which are conveniently very
slim --- just extracting the content, and indenting. We'll only do something
different when =utf-8= is set.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle (if (executable-find "latex2text") "yes" "no")
(after! ox-ascii
  (defvar org-ascii-convert-latex t
    "Use latex2text to convert LaTeX elements to unicode.")

  (defadvice! org-ascii-latex-environment-unicode-a (latex-environment _contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-ENVIRONMENT element from Org to ASCII, converting to unicode.
CONTENTS is nil.  INFO is a plist holding contextual
information."
    :override #'org-ascii-latex-environment
    (when (plist-get info :with-latex)
      (org-ascii--justify-element
       (org-remove-indentation
        (let* ((latex (org-element-property :value latex-environment))
               (unicode (and (eq (plist-get info :ascii-charset) 'utf-8)
                             org-ascii-convert-latex
                             (doom-call-process "latex2text" "-q" "--code" latex))))
          (if (= (car unicode) 0) ; utf-8 set, and sucessfully ran latex2text
              (cdr unicode) latex)))
       latex-environment info)))

  (defadvice! org-ascii-latex-fragment-unicode-a (latex-fragment _contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-FRAGMENT object from Org to ASCII, converting to unicode.

      (let* ((latex (org-element-property :value latex-fragment))

        (if (and unicode (= (car unicode) 0)) ; utf-8 set, and sucessfully ran latex2text

*** Markdown Export
**** GFM

Because of the /[[https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/wiki/markdown-flavors][lovely variety in markdown implementations]]/ there isn't actually
such a thing a standard table spec ... or standard anything really. Because
~org-md~ is a goody-two-shoes, it just uses HTML for all these non-standardised
elements (a lot of them). So ~ox-gfm~ is handy for exporting markdown with all the
features that GitHub has.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle packages.el
(package! ox-gfm :pin "99f93011b069e02b37c9660b8fcb45dab086a07f")
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref none :tangle yes
(use-package! ox-gfm
  :after ox)
#+end_src

**** Character substitutions

When I want to paste exported markdown somewhere (for example when using [[Emacs Everywhere][Emacs
Everywhere]]), it can be preferable to have unicode characters for =---= etc. instead
of =&#x2014;=.

To accomplish this, we just need to locally rebind the alist which provides
these substitution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defadvice! org-md-plain-text-unicode-a (orig-fn text info)
  "Locally rebind `org-html-special-string-regexps'"
  :around #'org-md-plain-text
  (let ((org-html-special-string-regexps
         '(("\\\\-" . "-")
           ("---\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "—\\1")
           ("--\\([^-]\\|$\\)" . "–\\1")
           ("\\.\\.\\." . "…")
           ("->" . "→")
           ("<-" . "←"))))
    (funcall orig-fn text (plist-put info :with-smart-quotes nil))))
#+end_src

In the future, I may want to check =info= to only have this active when =ox-gfm= is
being used.

Another worthwhile consideration is LaTeX formatting. It seems most Markdown
parsers are fixated on TeX-style syntax (=$= and =$$=). As unfortunate as this is,
it's probably best to accommodate them, for the sake of decent rendering.

=ox-md= doesn't provide any transcoders for this, so we'll have to whip up our own
and push them onto the =md= transcoders alist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(after! ox-md
  (defun org-md-latex-fragment (latex-fragment _contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-FRAGMENT object from Org to Markdown."
    (let ((frag (org-element-property :value latex-fragment)))
      (cond
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\(" frag)
        (concat "$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$"))
       ((string-match-p "^\\\\\\[" frag)
        (concat "$$" (substring frag 2 -2) "$$"))
       (t (message "unrecognised fragment: %s" frag)
          frag))))

  (defun org-md-latex-environment (latex-environment contents info)
    "Transcode a LATEX-ENVIRONMENT object from Org to Markdown."
    (concat "$$\n"
            (org-html-latex-environment latex-environment contents info)
            "$$\n"))

  (defun org-utf8-entity (entity _contents _info)
    "Transcode an ENTITY object from Org to utf-8.
CONTENTS are the definition itself.  INFO is a plist holding
contextual information."
    (org-element-property :utf-8 entity))

  ;; We can't let this be immediately parsed and evaluated,
  ;; because eager macro-expansion tries to call as-of-yet
  ;; undefined functions.
  ;; NOTE in the near future this shouldn't be required
  (eval
   '(dolist (extra-transcoder
             '((latex-fragment . org-md-latex-fragment)
               (latex-environment . org-md-latex-environment)
               (entity . org-utf8-entity)))
      (unless (member extra-transcoder (org-export-backend-transcoders

        (push extra-transcoder (org-export-backend-transcoders

*** Babel
Doom lazy-loads babel languages, with is lovely.
It also pulls in [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]], which is nice, but it would be even better if it was
used by default.

There are two caveats to =ob-async=:
1. It does not support =:session=
   + So, we don't want =:async= used when =:session= is set
2. It adds a fixed delay to execution
   + This is undesirable in a number of cases, for example it's generally
     unwanted with =emacs-lisp= code
   + As such, I also introduce a async language blacklist to control when it's
     automatically enabled

Due to the nuance in the desired behaviour, instead of just adding =:async= to
~org-babel-default-header-args~, I advice ~org-babel-get-src-block-info~ to add
=:async= intelligently. As an escape hatch, it also recognises =:sync= as an
indication that =:async= should not be added.

I did originally have this enabled for everything except for =emacs-lisp= and
=LaTeX= (there were weird issues), but this added  a ~3s "startup" cost to every
src block evaluation, which was a bit of a pain. Since =:async= can be added
easily with =#+properties=, I've turned this behaviour from a blacklist to a
whitelist.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-transient-hook! #'org-babel-execute-src-block
  (require 'ob-async))

(defvar org-babel-auto-async-languages '()
  "Babel languages which should be executed asyncronously by default.")

(defadvice! org-babel-get-src-block-info-eager-async-a (orig-fn &optional light datum)
  "Eagarly add an :async parameter to the src information, unless it seems problematic.
This only acts o languages in `org-babel-auto-async-languages'.
Not added when either:
+ session is not \"none\"
+ :sync is set"
  :around #'org-babel-get-src-block-info
  (let ((result (funcall orig-fn light datum)))
    (when (and (string= "none" (cdr (assoc :session (caddr result))))
               (member (car result) org-babel-auto-async-languages)
               (not (assoc :async (caddr result))) ; don't duplicate
               (not (assoc :sync (caddr result))))

*** Terminal viewing

Sometimes I'm in a terminal and I still want to see the content. Additionally,
sometimes I'd like to act on the textual content and so would like a plaintext version.
Thanks to src_shell{pdftotext} we have a convenient way of performing this conversion.
I've integrated this into a little package, =pdftotext.el=.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle packages.el
(package! pdftotext :recipe (:local-repo "lisp/pdftotext"))
#+end_src

The output can be slightly nicer without spelling errors, and with prettier page
feeds (=^L= by default).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
#+end_src

This is very nice, now we just need to associate it with =.pdf= files, and make
sure =pdf-tools= doesn't take priority.

Lastly, whenever Emacs is non-graphical (i.e. a TUI), we want to use this by default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle (if (executable-find "pdftotext") "yes" "no")
(use-package! pdftotext

** Markdown

Most of the time when I write markdown, it's going into some app/website which
will do it's own line wrapping, hence we /only/ want to use visual line wrapping. No hard stuff.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook! (gfm-mode markdown-mode) #'visual-line-mode #'turn-off-auto-fill)
#+end_src

Since markdown is often seen as rendered HTML, let's try to somewhat mirror the
style or markdown renderers.

Most markdown renders seem to make the first three headings levels larger than
normal text, the first two much so. Then the fourth level tends to be the same
as body text, while the fifth and sixth are (increasingly) smaller, with the
sixth greyed out. Since the sixth level is so small, I'll turn up the boldness a notch.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-faces!

** Beancount
There are a number of rather compelling advantages to [[https://plaintextaccounting.org/][plain text accounting]],
with [[https://www.ledger-cli.org/][ledger]] being the most obvious example. However, [[https://github.com/beancount/beancount][beancount]], a more recent
implementation of the idea is ledger-compatible (meaning I can switch easily if
I change my mind) and has a gorgeous front-end --- [[https://beancount.github.io/fava/][fava]].

Of course, there's an Emacs mode for this.
