;;
;;  Generated package (no.14) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;; Code:

(setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5) ;; I need the help, I really do

(setq which-key-allow-multiple-replacements t)
(after! which-key
  (pushnew!
   which-key-replacement-alist
   '(("" . "\\`+?evil[-:]?\\(?:a-\\)?\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◂\\1"))
   '(("\\`g s" . "\\`evilem--?motion-\\(.*\\)") . (nil . "◃\\1"))
   ))
