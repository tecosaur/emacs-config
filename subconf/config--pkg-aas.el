;;
;;  Generated package (no.29) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! aas :recipe (:host github :repo "ymarco/auto-activating-snippets")
;;     :pin "ddc2b7a58a2234477006af348b30e970f73bc2c1")

;;; Code:


(use-package! aas
  :commands aas-mode)

(provide 'config--pkg-aas)
