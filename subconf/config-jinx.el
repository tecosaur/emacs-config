;;
;;  Generated package (no.26) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;; Code:

(use-package! jinx
  :defer t
  :init
  (add-hook 'doom-init-ui-hook #'global-jinx-mode)
  :config
  ;; Use my custom dictionary
  (setq jinx-languages "en-custom")
  ;; Extra face(s) to ignore
  (push 'org-inline-src-block
        (alist-get 'org-mode jinx-exclude-faces))
  ;; Take over the relevant bindings.
  (after! ispell
    (global-set-key [remap ispell-word] #'jinx-correct))
  (after! evil-commands
    (global-set-key [remap evil-next-flyspell-error] #'jinx-next)
    (global-set-key [remap evil-prev-flyspell-error] #'jinx-previous))
  ;; I prefer for `point' to end up at the start of the word,
  ;; not just after the end.
  (advice-add 'jinx-next :after (lambda (_) (left-word))))

(provide 'config-jinx)
;;; config-jinx.el ends here
