;;
;;  Generated package (no.60) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;; Code:

(set-file-template! "\\.tex$" :trigger "__" :mode 'latex-mode)
(set-file-template! "\\.org$" :trigger "__" :mode 'org-mode)
(set-file-template! "/LICEN[CS]E$" :trigger '+file-templates/insert-license)

(provide 'config-file-templates)
;;; config-file-templates.el ends here
