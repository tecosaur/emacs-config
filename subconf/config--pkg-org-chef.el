;;
;;  Generated package (no.69) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! org-chef :pin "1710b54441ed744dcdfb125d08fb88cfaf452f10")

;;; Code:


(use-package! org-chef
  :commands (org-chef-insert-recipe org-chef-get-recipe-from-url))

(provide 'config--pkg-org-chef)
