;;
;;  Generated package (no.96) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.

;;; Code:

(require 'julia-mode)

(add-to-list
 'julia-font-lock-keywords
 '("^julia>" 0 '(font-lock-string-face bold) prepend))

(add-hook 'julia-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode-enable)
(add-hook! 'julia-mode-hook
  (setq-local lsp-enable-folding t
              lsp-folding-range-limit 100))

(provide 'config-julia)
