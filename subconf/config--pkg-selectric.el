;;
;;  Generated package (no.51) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! selectric-mode :pin "1840de71f7414b7cd6ce425747c8e26a413233aa")
;;
;;; Code:


(use-package! selectic-mode
  :commands selectic-mode)

(provide 'config--pkg-selectric)
;;; config--pkg-selectric.el ends here
