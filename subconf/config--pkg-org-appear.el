;;
;;  Generated package (no.63) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;  Package statement:
;;   (package! org-appear :recipe (:host github :repo "awth13/org-appear")
;;     :pin "32ee50f8fdfa449bbc235617549c1bccb503cb09")
;;
;;; Code:


(use-package! org-appear
  :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
  :config
  (setq org-appear-autoemphasis t
        org-appear-autosubmarkers t
        org-appear-autolinks nil)
  ;; for proper first-time setup, `org-appear--set-elements'
  ;; needs to be run after other hooks have acted.
  (run-at-time nil nil #'org-appear--set-elements))

(provide 'config--pkg-org-appear)
