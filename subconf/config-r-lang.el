;;
;;  Generated package (no.95) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;; Code:

(after! ess-r-mode
  (appendq! +ligatures-extra-symbols
            '(:assign "⟵"
              :multiply "×"))
  (set-ligatures! 'ess-r-mode
    ;; Functional
    :def "function"
    ;; Types
    :null "NULL"
    :true "TRUE"
    :false "FALSE"
    :int "int"
    :floar "float"
    :bool "bool"
    ;; Flow
    :not "!"
    :and "&&" :or "||"
    :for "for"
    :in "%in%"
