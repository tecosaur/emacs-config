;;
;;  Generated package (no.18) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;; Code:

(after! evil
  (setq evil-ex-substitute-global t     ; I like my s/../.. to by global by default
        evil-move-cursor-back nil       ; Don't move the block cursor when toggling insert mode
        evil-kill-on-visual-paste nil)) ; Don't put overwritten text in the kill ring

(provide 'config--pkg-evil)
;;; config--pkg-evil.el ends here
