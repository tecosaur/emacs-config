;;
;;  Generated package (no.77) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'org-roam)

(setq org-roam-directory "~/Desktop/TEC/Organisation/Roam/")

(defadvice! doom-modeline--buffer-file-name-roam-aware-a (orig-fun)
  :around #'doom-modeline-buffer-file-name ; takes no args
  (if (string-match-p (regexp-quote org-roam-directory) (or buffer-file-name ""))
      (replace-regexp-in-string
       "\\(?:^\\|.*/\\)\\([0-9]\\{4\\}\\)\\([0-9]\\{2\\}\\)\\([0-9]\\{2\\}\\)[0-9]*-"
