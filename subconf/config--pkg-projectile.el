;;
;;  Generated package (no.25) from my config.
;;
;;  During generation, dependency on other aspects of my configuration and
;;  packages is inferred via (regexp-based) static analysis.  While this seems
;;  to do a good job, this method is imperfect.  This code likely depends on
;;  utilities provided by Doom, and if you try to run it in isolation you may
;;  discover the code makes more assumptions.
;;
;;  That said, I've found pretty good results so far.
;;
;;; Code:

(setq projectile-ignored-projects
      (list "~/" "/tmp" (expand-file-name "straight/repos" doom-local-dir)))
(defun projectile-ignored-project-function (filepath)
  "Return t if FILEPATH is within any of `projectile-ignored-projects'"
  (or (mapcar (lambda (p) (string-prefix-p p filepath)) projectile-ignored-projects)))

(provide 'config--pkg-projectile)
